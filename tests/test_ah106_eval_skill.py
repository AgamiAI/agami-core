"""The eval helper: what it prints, in what order, and what it refuses to print.

`run_golden_eval.py` is the only caller of `run_golden_dataset` that a person can invoke, so the
things it decides are not covered anywhere else: which dataset a bare invocation runs, what a
verdict looks like on a terminal, and — the load-bearing one — that the statements never reach
that terminal. Two sentinel strings, one planted in the answer key and one in the generated
statement, make the last of those a real assertion rather than an inspection.

The generator is replaced with a scripted one, for the reason the end-to-end file gives: a run in
CI must not spend a token, and a live model would make a failing ordering assertion ambiguous
between the ordering and the statement it happened to write. Everything else is real — the shipped
sample store, the reader, the chokepoint and the comparator.

#
# Everything below asserts on SKILL.md rather than on code, for the reason
# `test_skill_guardrails.py` gives: these behaviors have no code-level equivalent. The helper cannot
# make the model separate the unconfirmed from the failures, refuse to paste a statement it can
# read out of the artifact, or say that a run of nothing but errors is not green — the skill is the
# only place those live, so "the skill says X" is the only decidable check there is.
