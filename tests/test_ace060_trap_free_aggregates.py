"""ACE-060 — for every aggregate, whether a join multiplies the rows its value is computed from.

REQ-022 asks for the fact *per aggregate*. ACE-094 landed the finding channel that carries it, and
the section built from that channel was keyed per FINDING — so an aggregate the analysis cleared
produced no item, and the only thing the section could say about a sound number was nothing. An
absent item and an unchecked section read identically to a consumer, which is the confusion
`ReceiptSection.undetermined` exists one level up to remove; keyed per finding, it was reintroduced
one level down.

What this battery pins:

  * every aggregate in the output SELECT list is one item, saying one of three things;
  * a fan or chasm names THE AGGREGATE and the join, not the measure table;
  * an aggregate the analysis could not resolve says so rather than claiming to be clean — the
    `COUNT(*)` case, which is the one place per-aggregate keying could have manufactured a false
    clean bill of health out of an absence;
  * the section's marker is composed per statement and reaches null, which is the state that means
    "established, here it is" and which one fixed sentence made unreachable;
  * a trap still executes and is still never a refusal.

The model is ACE-094's, imported rather than re-declared: it arms all four conditions at once
(`orders` on the ONE side of a many-to-one for fan; `orders` and `subscriptions` sharing `customers`
for chasm; an `averageable` column for aggregation class; a semi-additive metric for the fourth),
and a second copy of it would be a second thing to keep in step for no gain.
