"""ACE-059 — the `joins` section describes the joins the STATEMENT wrote.

The section used to be built from the MODEL: one item per declared relationship whose two tables
were both in scope. That is a description of the model filtered by the statement, not a description
of the statement — a relationship the statement never traversed was listed, and a join the
statement DID write that the model does not declare was invisible. The receipt's whole job is to
say what ran.

What this slice pins:

  * one item per `exp.Join` node, each carrying the predicate as the parser read it, the two
    endpoints as the statement wrote them, the query scope, and exactly one status;
  * a written join matches a declared relationship on an unordered set of `(table, column)` pairs,
    declared as a SUBSET of written — so operand order does not decide it and a filtering conjunct
    does not weaken it — in both the FK form and the `on:` escape hatch, and across the cross-area
    edges the old walk never loaded. **A join between the same two declared tables on different
    columns reads `undeclared`**, which is the regression: the old build listed it as declared;
  * a join whose endpoint is a name the statement bound for itself (a CTE, a derived table, a CTE
    shadowing a declared table) is `undeclarable` — a name the statement invented cannot carry a
    declaration — and that is settled, where an ON this layer could not reduce to a pair is not;
  * an explicit `CROSS JOIN` wrote no predicate, which is a settled fact and reports `undeclared`;
  * the comma join wrote its predicate into the WHERE, which this layer does not attribute, so it
    is `undetermined`;
  * the marker counts only what is UNSETTLED, so a statement with no joins and a statement whose
    joins are all settled both reach null — the state that means "established, here it is";
  * a statement whose joins are all undeclared executes and is never refused;
  * the cap, the predicate's bound, and the same section on every run.

The model is this battery's own rather than the one ACE-088/094/060 share: no governance fixture
declares an `on:` relationship or a cross-area edge, and adding either to a shared fixture would
move every receipt those batteries assert on.
