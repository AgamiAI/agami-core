"""Adversarial suite for the SELECT * ban + column-scope guard.

Each case is an attempt to slip an undeclared column or a `*` past the gate. A
green happy-path suite (test_column_scope_gate.py) does NOT prove the gate holds
against evasion — these do. Cases fall into four groups:

  * star-ban evasion            -> must refuse (kind: select_star)
  * column-scope evasion        -> must refuse (kind: column_out_of_scope)
  * documented accepted fail-open -> asserts *allow*, so a future narrowing of the
                                    boundary is a conscious, test-breaking decision
  * upstream-owned              -> asserts a different layer already catches it

The set-operation cases (UNION arm) are the regressions that prove the fix for the
`parse_one -> exp.Union is not exp.Select` bypass that also affected check_table_scope.
