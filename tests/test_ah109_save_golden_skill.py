"""The save-golden skill's prose, and the shared docs that route to it.

Everything here asserts on Markdown rather than on code, for the reason `test_ah106_eval_skill.py`
gives about its own doc section: these behaviors have no code-level equivalent. The helper cannot
make the model render the parsed rows before importing them, refuse to invent SQL for a question
that has none, or decline to glob a neighbouring profile for a file shape — the skill is the only
place those live, so "the skill says X" is the only decidable check there is.

The one exception is the last test, which asserts on code precisely because it can: the answer key
must not be reachable from the MCP surface, and that is a fact about `tools.py`.
