@pytest.fixture(autouse=True)
def _enforce_governance(monkeypatch):
    """Run the whole suite with the semantic-model pass ON (ACE-101).

    `AGAMI_GOVERNANCE_ENFORCED` defaults OFF, because a hosted deployment has to be able to ship
    before the gates have met real customer traffic. The suite is not that deployment. It tests the
    PRODUCT (the gates, their rules, and their receipts), so it pins the variable on and the
    off-path gets its own file (`test_ace101_governance_flag.py`).

    Without it, 33 tests across five files fail, measured by removing this fixture and re-running,
    not assumed. They fail LOUDLY rather than going quietly green, because the hosted suites assert a
    specific `rule` on a refusal and a statement that executed carries none; `test_ace051_fail_closed`,
    `test_ace098_completeness` and `test_ace035_no_enumeration` are the bulk of it. So this fixture is
    not protection against silent erosion, which is what it looks like at first glance. It is the line
    that says which posture the suite is written against, in one place instead of five, and it keeps a
    deployment default from being mistaken for a product decision.

    Declared FIRST in this file so it is set before any other autouse fixture can import or execute
    against it. It mutates `os.environ`, which every `subprocess.run` that passes no explicit `env`
    inherits, including the vendored-slice probes in `test_ace088_receipt_placement.py` and
    ACE-071's entry-point parity children. Those run LOCAL (`_hosted()` false), where the switch is
    never consulted, so the inheritance is inert by construction rather than by luck.

    Set through `monkeypatch` rather than by assigning `os.environ`, the same idiom
    `_isolate_query_log` below uses, so a test that needs the OFF posture just overrides it and gets
    the suite default restored at teardown, with no ordering coupling between files.

def _isolate_artifacts_dir(tmp_path_factory, monkeypatch):
    """Keep the developer's own artifacts directory out of the suite entirely (#293).

    **One level EARLIER in the resolution chain than the two fixtures below**, and that gap is what
    the issue reported: they redirect `tools.CONFIG_PATH` and `tools.QUERY_LOG`, which are files
    *inside* the artifacts dir, while `agami_paths.artifacts_dir()` was still resolving the dir
    itself from the machine. Anything reading straight out of that directory — `organization.yaml`
    above all, which carries a real minted `org_id` once a deployment has introspected — bypassed
    both and leaked real content into the test.

    The symptom is the one a test can least explain: ~39 failures reporting a value from a file no
    test mentions, on a contributor's machine, while CI stays green because CI has neither the
    pointer nor the directory. Confirmed by renaming `~/.config/agami/path`, which made every one of
    them pass with no other change.

    **Both doors, not only the pointer.** `artifacts_dir()` reads `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR`, then the
    pointer file, then `DEFAULT_ARTIFACTS_DIR` — and a contributor who accepted the default has a
    populated `~/agami-artifacts` with no pointer at all, so redirecting the pointer alone would fix
    one machine and not the next. The env var is deliberately left alone: a test that sets it is
    saying which directory it wants, and this fixture must not overrule that.

    Both are redirected to paths under a tmp dir that are never created, which is exactly the state
    CI runs in. A test wanting a real artifacts dir sets one up and overwrites this, as it does with
    the two fixtures below.

    # artifacts dir and leaves a tombstone — and several tests call `bootstrap_paths()`. So on a
    # contributor with a pre-consolidation install, running the tests could consolidate their real
    # home directory as a side effect. That is a step beyond the leak above: reading the machine
    # gives a wrong answer, writing to it takes something away. A migration test that wants a legacy

    Same hazard as `_isolate_query_log` above, on the read side. `tools.CONFIG_PATH` is resolved at
    import time from the real artifacts dir and only re-resolved by `bootstrap_paths()`, so a test
    that sets `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` to a `tmp_path` does NOT move it — `_load_config()` still reads
    `~/agami-artifacts/local/.config`. `resolve_profile` consults `.config.active_profile` BEFORE
    the sole-served-datasource step, so on any machine that has run the CLI, that file's real
    profile name short-circuits resolution and every test of the store step asserts against it
    instead of against what the test set up.

    That made the store-step tests pass in CI (no `.config` there) and fail on a contributor's
    machine — the failure mode a test is least able to explain, since the value it reports comes
    from a file the test never mentions. Point it at a path that does not exist, which is the state
    `_load_config()` is written for and the one CI already had; a test that wants a `.config` sets

    that calls it in-process owns the whole session instead.

    The silencing is right in production: the CLI child's stderr is a wire carrying exactly one JSON
    object, so a diagnostic line there makes the refusal unparseable. But it is a permanent mutation
    of a module-level logger (a NullHandler plus `propagate = False`) with no restore, and
    `propagate = False` is precisely what stops a record from reaching `caplog`. So every test that
    runs AFTER an in-process `main()` sees a logger that can no longer be asserted on, and a test
    proving the operator gets the cause of a failure passes or fails on file ordering alone.

    Restored around every test rather than in the callers: there are five of them across two files
    today, the next one will not know it is the fourth thing to trip this, and the failure it causes
    lands in someone else's test.
