"""ACE-107 — `get_datasource_schema` answers within the scope the caller DECLARED.

Two independent defects, one cause: the tool did not treat a declared scope as meaning anything.

  * It **discarded** what a table-scoped call had already resolved. `_table_contexts` asked
    `get_table_context` for relationships and metrics and then kept only `ctx["tables"]`, so the
    call whose whole purpose is per-table detail returned columns and no way to join them — while
    the tool's own description promised both. A client could only write the join if a human had
    put it in the prose narrative.
  * It sent the **whole metric catalogue on every call**, under a never-hide guarantee written
    for the verbosity ladder (`full -> summary -> index` under a char budget), where the client
    asked for everything and silently got less. A scoped call is the opposite situation.

The guarantee is now scope-relative: **within the scope you declared, nothing is hidden** — the
scope's own metrics, plus the cross-area bucket. Scope is DECLARED (`area`, `dataset_names`) and
never inferred: `query` ranks and `metric_names` selects detail, and narrowing on either would
silently deprive a caller who never said "I am only working here".

The model this was found on has **zero** metrics with an empty `source_tables` and **zero**
cross-area metrics naming a scoped table, so neither edge is reachable by testing against a real
model. Both are built synthetically here — that is the whole reason this file has its own
fixture rather than borrowing the sizing suite's.
