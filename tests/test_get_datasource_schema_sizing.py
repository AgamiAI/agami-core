"""Smart get_datasource_schema — adaptive sizing by subject-area + char budget + metric ranking.

The server (not the client) decides payload verbosity so one tool call fits the context window:
`mode=auto` picks full/summary/index by subject-area count; a ~60K-char budget downgrades even a
forced `full`; a `query` lexically ranks metrics. All decidable on a synthetic model here.
