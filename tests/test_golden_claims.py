"""What two statements are allowed to say about each other, and what they are not.

`golden_claims` reads a statement into seven structured claims and compares two of them. It is a
DESCRIBER with two gates, and the split is the whole design: five of the seven claims are reported
for a person to read, and only two — a required column that is filtered nowhere, and a date window
that resolves to a different interval — are allowed to decide anything. Those two were selected
because neither can false-positive: a column is either constrained somewhere in the statement's own
predicates or it is not, and a window either resolves on both sides or the comparison is not made.

Three properties this file exists to hold still, because each is tempting to "improve":

* **Unresolved is not disagreement.** A window written in a form the resolver does not model reads
  `unknown` and gates nothing. Folding it to a partial interval would let a statement that filters
  correctly fail a golden item on the resolver's own incompleteness.
* **The comparison of two windows ignores the column they constrain.** Two statements over the same
  table may spell the same column `o.order_date` and `order_date`; a gate that read those as two
  different windows would refuse a correct rewrite on a qualifier. The four bound fields decide, and
  the column rides along so the report can name it.
* **The must_filter scan errs toward "filtered".** It reads every predicate the statement writes —
  WHERE, every join's ON, HAVING, QUALIFY, and an aggregate's own FILTER — because the gate's job is
  to catch an outright absence, and a scan that missed one of those spellings would call a filtered
  statement unfiltered.

Synthetic fixtures throughout: a `demo` shop over `orders` and `customers`.
