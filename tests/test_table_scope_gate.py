"""Table-scope guard: a query may only reference tables the semantic model declares.

Runs in the SAME shared safety pass as the fan/chasm pre-flight and the sensitive
gate (execute_sql.py:_model_safety), so every engine entry point refuses a query
that touches a table outside the model — not just whichever path obeyed a prose
rule. Only physical table refs count; CTE names and derived-subquery aliases are
not tables. Excluded (review_state='rejected') tables are dropped by the loader,
so they never reach `_model_table_index` and land in the same "not declared →
refuse" path exercised here via undeclared names.
