"""A capability the server has and the surface never mentions is a capability no client uses.

Four things shipped working and undocumented, which is a worse failure than shipping them broken:
a broken feature gets reported, a silent one just never gets called.

  - `execute_sql` returns three statuses and the description named two. The third, `failed`, is the
    whole database-error channel, carrying a `kind` from a declared ten-value enum. An agent that
    has never been told the shape exists meets it for the first time in the one situation where it
    is least able to reason about it, and improvises instead of retrying.
  - `list_datasources` has always returned `database_type` and `table_count`, and described
    neither. So the dialect was guessed on every non-metric expression, and the schema call was
    made blind to how big the answer would be.
  - `get_datasource_schema` ships each table's declared `default_filters` in its payload and its
    description named none of them. A declared filter was therefore first MET on the receipt —
    after the statement it belonged in had already run.

The tests derive from what the code emits rather than restating the strings, for the reason
`test_hosted_instruction_truth` gives about `binding`: a literal-vs-literal assertion passes right
up until someone renames the thing, and then it passes anyway. Add a `FailureKind` and this file is
what tells you the surface still lists nine.
