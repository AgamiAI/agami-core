"""The audit trail is real: one `query_executions` row per `execute_sql` call, on every outcome,
keyed by the very `audit_id` the answer carried back.

Three claims, in order of how load-bearing they are:

  1. **Refusals are recorded at all.** The write used to hang off `_finalize_execution`, which only
     ever runs on success — so the trail held the queries that worked and silently dropped every
     decision we made against one. The outcomes most worth reviewing were exactly the ones a
     reviewer could not find. It now hangs off `_emit`, the single tool-edge serializer, so `ok`,
     `refused` and `failed` all land, on **both** transports.
  2. **`Envelope.audit_id` IS `query_executions.id`.** Not a parallel identifier and not a join key:
     the sink writes the caller's id as the row's primary key, so a caller can look up the record of
     its own execution. The sink used to mint a uuid inside the INSERT and discard it, which made
     the id unreferenceable the moment it existed.
  3. **A broken sink is never silent, and on a served deployment it is never survivable.** ACE-097
     split what was one claim: locally, best-effort still means the answer is unchanged to the byte
     and the failure is still logged; served, principle 7 makes the row part of the call, so a write
     that fails takes the call with it. Both halves are pinned below. What did not change is that
     the failure must never be able to break a query merely by failing to OPEN in an uncontrolled
     place — the bug that shipped when `Store.from_env()` sat outside its try, and the reason the
     served path can now re-raise deliberately from one place.

Both surfaces are driven for real — a `python -m mcp_harness` subprocess speaking JSON-RPC on stdin,
and `TestClient` over `create_app()`'s `/mcp` — rather than by calling the handler, because "the row
is written on both surfaces" is a claim about the transports, and the two run different execution
paths (the stdio default forks `python -m execute_sql`; `create_app`'s default adapters carry the
built-in executor and run in-process).

    `ExecutorError` — so a pooled executor's `PoolError` walked straight past the chokepoint.
