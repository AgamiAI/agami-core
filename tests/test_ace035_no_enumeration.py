"""The enumeration sentinel: a refusal echoes, but never enumerates.

The locked rule, in two halves:

  * **Echo is allowed, and bounded.** An identifier the caller put in its own statement may be named
    back to it. That discloses nothing it did not already send, and it is what makes a refusal
    actionable — "column(s) not in the semantic model: ref_no" tells the caller which of its own
    names to fix. But the statement is written by an LLM and a quoted identifier can hold any text
    at all, so an unbounded echo is a laundering channel rather than a disclosure one: the caller's
    text comes back inside `refusal.detail`, which is tool output the calling model weights as
    server-authored. The echo is therefore capped in count and per-name length and stripped of every
    character outside an identifier's alphabet — see "The echo is bounded" below.
  * **Enumeration is not.** The declared surface must never be listed. A refusal that names the
    alternatives ("declared tables here are: orders, customers, …") turns every refusal into a
    schema-listing endpoint, reachable by anyone who can send one deliberately-wrong statement —
    which is the recon surface a later slice exists to close.

**This file is lock-in, not a fix.** All five gates were echo-only when they were converted, and the
per-statement timeout that has since joined them is too; it is asserted here so a later reword cannot
quietly turn a refusal into a listing. Unlike the rest of this spec's tests, the property this one
pins is expected to hold on `446cc20` (the pre-conversion base) as well — and it does. It was checked
by running this file's model, canaries, vectors and scanner against a materialized `446cc20` tree,
driving the five rules that existed then through all four routes below and scanning the 20 refusal
bodies the base produced: all clean. (The `resource_limit` vector came later and has no counterpart
there — nothing imposed a per-statement bound at that commit. The file cannot be *collected* at that
commit either — `guardrail` does not exist there and the tool edge speaks
`{"error": {kind, remediation}}` rather than the Envelope — so the base run drops only the two shape
assertions, `status == "refused"` and `refusal.rule == …`, and keeps the scanner verbatim.) A future
failure here is therefore a live disclosure bug, not a conversion regression.

**What this file covers.** Every field of the serialized tool-edge body, for the six refusal rules
and for a `failed` — across both surfaces and both execution paths. `failure.message` is in scope
because it is part of that body: it was the one field the scanner never saw, and it is where a
PostgreSQL `HINT: Perhaps you meant to reference the column "orders.internal_ref".` arrives, which
is enumeration reaching the caller through the operational channel rather than the guardrail one.

**What it does NOT cover, in two different senses.**

*Fixed by ACE-039.* Driver text used to be relayed to `failure.message` unsanitized, so a driver
that volunteered a declared name put it in front of the caller. That was measured here rather than
assumed, as an `xfail(strict=True)`; the error-hardening slice now classifies FROM the driver text
and returns a fixed value-free sentence INSTEAD of it, the marker is gone, and
`test_a_driver_hint_never_reaches_the_caller` asserts the closed shape. Everything reaching
`failure.message` is now value-free on every path: the classified sentences, the guarded path's
catch-all fixed string, and the forked path, which no longer relays unstructured child stderr.

*Not fixable here.* The table- and column-scope details confirm "this identifier is not in the
model", which is a one-bit membership oracle per probed identifier: a caller willing to send N
statements learns N bits about the declared surface. That is inherent to the existing design, is
carried across verbatim by this work, and is deliberately unchanged here. It is prior art for the
recon slice (`guardrail.RULE_RECON` is already declared and unassigned for it). A reader who takes
"no enumeration" to mean "no inference" has read this file too generously: it bounds what a refusal
*states*, not what a persistent caller can *infer*.

The model is defined in this file rather than imported, for the same reason
`test_ace035_gate_verdict_parity.py` copies its fixtures: a sentinel whose canary can be
re-pointed by an edit to another test file is not a sentinel.
