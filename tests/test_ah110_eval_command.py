"""The eval helper's exit contract: what a run's exit code says, and what it refuses to say.

`run_golden_eval.py` printed verdicts and exited 0 for every run that reached the end of its
wiring, which made it unusable as a gate — CI cannot tell a clean suite from one where the
generator was never on the machine. This file pins the three answers it now gives (`0` green,
`1` a confirmed regression, `2` no verdict at all) and, more importantly, the ORDER in which they
are decided: a run that both stopped partway and has failures in it reports the broken pipeline,
because sending somebody to debug a model change that never happened is the expensive mistake.

The fixtures are the sibling file's: the shipped sample store, the real reader, chokepoint and
comparator, and a scripted generator in place of the client — a run in CI must not spend a token,
and a live model would make an exit-code assertion ambiguous between the contract and whatever
statement the model happened to write.
