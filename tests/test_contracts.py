"""The 4-tool pydantic contracts mirror the existing local tool I/O.

The load-bearing check: a real sample of each tool's **current** stdio output parses into its
contract and dumps back **without loss** — proving the contracts match the local,
subject-area-primary shape. Samples here are copied from the dicts in `mcp_harness.py`.

The trust receipt is deliberately not among them: it is typed by `guardrail.Receipt` and asserted
against the real tool-edge serializer, not respelled in pydantic here.
