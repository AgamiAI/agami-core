"""F14 / ACE-056–057 end-to-end: the deployment mints a portable org identity, keeps it immutable,
and the deploy-stamp + serve-resolve agree on it — the invariant the whole feature rests on.

No network is touched (the id is a local uuid4 + a file write); `tests/test_privacy_no_network.py`
is the separate static gate that proves no egress primitive was introduced.
