"""The surface dimension: the plugin's vendored library, held to the same verdicts as the package.

The plugin ships its own copy of the executor slice — `plugins/agami/lib/` — because a marketplace
install has no `packages/` sibling and nothing pip-installs the library. A user running a query
through the plugin is therefore running DIFFERENT FILES from the ones every other test in this
suite drives, and "both surfaces in sync" is the claim about what the two decide. Nothing proved it
end to end before this file.

**It is proved in two halves, and the split is structural rather than a convenience.**
`dev.py::_VENDORED` mirrors `agami_paths`, `execute_sql`, `guardrail`, `sql_guard` and the
`semantic_model` package init — and deliberately NOT `semantic_model/runtime.py`, which is where
`table_scope`, `column_scope`, `select_star` and `unscopable` live and which needs pydantic and
sqlglot the vendored path is designed not to require. Those four rules cannot fire on the plugin
surface at all, so a test asserting they do would be asserting something the design says is false.

  * **The contract, symbol for symbol.** `REASON_FOR_RULE`, `Receipt.SECTIONS`, `PRE_MODEL_RULES`
    and every `RULE_*` are compared across the two import roots as LOADED OBJECTS. The byte-level
    pin already exists — `tests/test_plugin_lib_resolution.py::test_vendored_lib_matches_source`
    compares the files — and this is the other end of it: identical bytes that fail to produce
    identical symbols would mean the module read differently, and identical symbols with drifted
    bytes are what that test catches. Neither replaces the other.
  * **The behaviour.** Below.

**ACE-071 (`c11d732`) changed what the behavioural half can honestly claim, and this file now
asserts the new contract rather than the one it was written against.** Until that commit the
vendored executor met the missing runtime with a shrug: `_model_safety` took its `except Exception`
arm, handed the statement back untouched, and the plugin ran it with table scope, the star ban and
column scope all off. ACE-071 made that arm fail closed. When a model is DECLARED for the profile —
`<artifacts>/<profile>/datasource.yaml` exists — and the guards cannot be imported, the executor
refuses `model_unavailable` / `undetermined` instead of executing. A modelless install stays inert
by design: nothing is declared, so nothing is undetermined.

So the behavioural half is no longer "the same verdict on the rules that reach the plugin".
Measured on this branch over all 84 file-engine corpus vectors, with a model declared — the state
any install past its first `agami-connect` is in:

  * **36 vectors decide identically**: the 31 `read_only` and the 5 `recon` ones. Their producer is
    the vendored `sql_guard` and it runs ABOVE `_model_safety` at the chokepoint, so the new branch
    cannot pre-empt them. That set is not hand-listed here; it is derived from the contract's own
    `PRE_MODEL_RULES` — see `STATEMENT_REACHABLE_RULES`.
  * **48 vectors now diverge, every one of them in the same direction.** Where the package answers
    `ok` (16) or refuses with a rule only the model pass can produce — `table_scope` 12,
    `select_star` 6, `column_scope` 5, `unscopable` 5, `unparseable` 2 — the vendored surface
    refuses `model_unavailable` and returns nothing.
  * **`resource_limit` moved from the first group to the second.** Its producer IS vendored, but it
    is produced in `execute_sql` AFTER `_model_safety` returns, so the new branch shadows it. It is
    not gone: `test_a_modelless_vendored_install_still_answers_and_still_bounds` reaches it on the
    same surface with the model taken away, which is what makes "shadowed" a measured statement
    rather than a guess about a dead gate.

**This is a narrower parity claim than the one this file made before, and stating it narrowly is
the honest option rather than a concession.** The two surfaces agreed on 54 vectors and now agree
on 36. What replaced the agreement is not silence: it is a stronger safety property asserted in its
place — on the 48 the vendored surface no longer executes AT ALL, where before it executed
unguarded. A test that kept the old wording would be reporting parity that no longer exists; a test
that only asserted "it refuses" would let the surface refuse for any reason at all. Both halves are
asserted below, by rule.

**Which root actually answered.** `_agami_lib.ensure_importable()` falls back to
`packages/agami-core/src` when the bundled `lib/` is missing or incomplete, silently and by design —
so a parity test that merely ran and passed could be the package answering under the plugin's name,
twice. Every call below runs under `python -S` (site-packages hidden, so an installed agami-core is
invisible) inside a copied marketplace cache that has no `packages/` sibling to fall back TO, and
`test_the_marketplace_layout_answers_from_the_bundled_lib` asserts the resolved module files by
path before any verdict is compared.

    The 48 vectors this file used to either assert parity on (the 16 governed and the 2
    `resource_limit`) or leave out entirely (the 30 scope / `unscopable` / `unparseable` ones),
    now under one assertion because ACE-071 gave them one answer. Whatever the package decides —
    `ok`, `table_scope`, `select_star`, `column_scope`, `unscopable`, `unparseable`,
    `resource_limit` — the vendored surface never gets far enough to decide it, because
    `_model_safety` refuses first on a model it can see declared and cannot read.

    Both sides are asserted and that is the point. Asserting only the vendored half would pass on a
    surface that refused `model_unavailable` for every statement ever sent, including the writes
    the lexer is supposed to catch first; asserting only the package half would not be about this
    surface at all. Together they say: the divergence is exactly here, it runs in exactly one
    direction, and the safe side is the vendored one.

    `remediation` and `detail` are deliberately not compared anywhere in this file. The two surfaces
    are now giving advice about different things — "narrow the statement" against "use the
    interpreter that has the package" — and pinning the wording would pin the mirror to a model
    stack it exists to do without.

    """The audit probe still runs in front of the model check, and after ACE-071 that ordering is
    finally observable instead of merely structural.

    Both refusals are live on this surface now, which is what changed. `_audit_store_reachable`
    opens the store through `store.py`, not vendored, so a SERVED vendored deployment cannot record
    and refuses `audit_unavailable`; `_model_safety` cannot import the guards against a model it can
    see declared, so it refuses `model_unavailable`. `execute_guarded` runs the audit probe first,
    above even the read-only gate, so the served configuration gets `audit_unavailable` — including
    one whose store is perfectly healthy, asserted below with a real, openable SQLite store rather
    than the broken URL, because the broken one would reach the same verdict for the ordinary reason
    and prove nothing about the ordering.

    **The control is what makes this an ordering claim.** Before ACE-071 the model branch did not
    exist on this path, so "the audit probe pre-empts the model check" was satisfied by there being
    nothing to pre-empt. The second call below takes `AGAMI_DB_URL` away and nothing else — same
    cache, same declared model, same statement — and gets `model_unavailable`. So the model refusal
    is armed in both runs and the audit probe really is what comes first.

    Read as a security property it is the strongest possible fail-closed: the mirror cannot execute
    a statement in a served deployment at all, and since ACE-071 it cannot execute one against a
    declared model either.

    The store is CREATED and MIGRATED here, which it was not: the path was pointed at a file nothing
    had made, so "a real, openable SQLite store" was a claim the test did not arrange and the case it
    says it rules out — the broken URL reaching this verdict for the ordinary reason — was exactly
    the case being run. `test_safety_envelope.py::served` builds one the same way, and its existence
    is asserted before the verdict so a store that failed to appear cannot pass this quietly.

    the consequence of that missing producer is no longer the one this test was written to pin.

    The premise still holds: `semantic_model/runtime.py` is not vendored, so `table_scope`,
    `column_scope`, `select_star` and `unscopable` have no producer on this surface and cannot
    appear in any verdict it returns. That absence is asserted in two places already and is not
    restated here — `test_the_marketplace_layout_answers_from_the_bundled_lib` pins that
    `semantic_model.runtime` does not import in this layout, and
    `test_the_vendored_executor_refuses_where_the_package_consults_the_model` pins the rule each of
    the 28 scope vectors actually comes back with, which is `model_unavailable` and therefore never
    a scope rule. This test is about the CONSEQUENCE of that absence, on one vector, in full.

    **What changed is the consequence, and it changed in the best direction.** This test used to
    assert that `SELECT *` ran on the plugin surface and handed back every column the table has —
    true when it was written, and the loudest demonstration of what "the plugin path has no semantic
    model" meant. ACE-071 replaced that with a refusal: the executor already published
    `RECEIPT_NO_RUNTIME` for exactly this state, principle 4c makes undetermined a refusal, and it
    now acts on its own conclusion. So the assertion here is strictly stronger than the one it
    replaces — the statement does not run, and nothing comes back — and the package surface still
    refuses the same statement with `select_star`, which is what keeps this a measured divergence
    rather than a note about a surface nobody compared.

    **Two things could now close this split, and either one fails this test.**
    `semantic_model/runtime.py` joining `dev.py::_VENDORED` would give the four rules a producer
    here and the two halves would become one. So would the fail-closed branch going away — by
    vendoring the model stack, or by the branch being narrowed or removed — which would put the old
    fail-open behaviour back. The first is the split closing; the second is a regression wearing its
