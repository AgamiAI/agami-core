"""The tests that check the SUITE rather than the chokepoint.

Everything else in this directory asks what `execute_sql` decided. These ask whether the run asking
is capable of finding out — and each closes a hole that was open, not a hypothetical one.

  * **The workflow has to arm the sentinels.** Every other layer of this spec was made structural
    precisely so that coverage could not be dropped by an edit: the markers replaced a `-k`, the
    counts replaced a hope, `importorfail` replaced `importorskip`. And all of it hung off one line
    of YAML. Deleting `AGAMI_IT_PG_REQUIRED` from the DB job, or blanking it, puts `importorfail`
    and both halves of the sentinel to sleep together; taking the password with it drops the whole
    DB half to a module-level skip and an exit code of 0. Nothing in the repository noticed. This
    reads the workflow and asserts the jobs are armed.
  * **The stdio child has to be THIS checkout.** `route_stdio` spawns a real process, and a child
    inherits none of the parent's `sys.path`. Without `PYTHONPATH` it resolved `mcp_harness` and
    `execute_sql` from whatever `agami-core` was pip-installed — on the machine this was found on,
    a different worktree's copy. The transport-parity claim was then comparing two branches rather
    than two transports.
  * **The role the suite tests has to be the role operators get.**
    `tests/integration/fixtures/postgres-readonly-grants.sql` is a second copy of the recipe shipped
    in `plugins/agami/shared/readonly-grants.md`, and its own header says so — but nothing enforced
    it. The role is the primary, non-bypassable integrity control, so a fixture that drifts turns
    the whole DB half green on a role no operator has: a false certification of exactly the kind
    this spec exists to prevent. This diffs the two.

This file must not skip when there is no database, because the required `lint + test` job is where
it earns its keep: that job runs `pytest tests/`, has no Postgres, and is the check branch
protection requires. So it takes no database fixture and imports `harness` lazily, inside the one
test that needs a transport.
