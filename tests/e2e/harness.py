"""The end-to-end harness the safety corpus runs on: the transports, and the file-served path.

Two things live here and nothing else.

**The routes.** A route takes `(sql, profile)` and returns the parsed tool-edge body — the JSON a
caller actually receives. `in_process` calls the tool directly with the built-in executor injected;
`http` goes through `mcp_http.create_app()`'s authenticated `/mcp` over `TestClient`, which is the
transport the hosted deployment serves; `stdio` runs `python -m mcp_harness` as a real child
process, which is the transport a local client launches. They are shaped after the four-route
matrix in
`tests/test_ace035_no_enumeration.py` and deliberately copied rather than imported: a harness whose
transports can be re-pointed by an edit to another test file is not a harness, and that file's
routes are bound to its own model fixture.

**The file-served model path.** `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` for the model and `DATASOURCE_URL__<PROFILE>`
for the warehouse — the two axes are orthogonal and this module wires the file/SQLite corner of
them. Both sides are derived from `safety.corpus.SCHEMA`, so the semantic model and the physical
tables cannot describe different columns; a governed vector that returns rows is returning the
rows this module seeded, against the model the gates read.

The model is written RICH rather than minimal — a declared relationship, an unreviewed metric, an
AI-written column description, a declared filter and a row estimate — because a model that declares
nothing produces receipt sections that are present and say nothing, and the point of a receipt
assertion is to reach the assembler's real output rather than its empty case. That richness is now
ENFORCED rather than merely intended:
`test_safety_corpus.py::test_every_receipt_section_says_something_on_some_governed_vector` requires
each section to carry real items on some governed vector, so dropping any of the five declarations
above turns this file's cost into a failing test instead of a quietly empty receipt.
