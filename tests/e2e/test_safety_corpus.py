"""Every vector of the safety corpus, driven through the real `execute_sql` tool over HTTP.

This is the file that makes the corpus a regression gate rather than a list. Each vector goes in as
a `tools/call` on the authenticated `/mcp` endpoint and the serialized tool-edge body comes back,
so what is asserted is what a caller actually receives — not what a gate returns to its own caller
one frame in.

**A refused vector asserts its RULE and its REASON, never merely that it was refused.**
`status == "refused"` reads green while the gate that owns the rule never fires: the bracket-quoted
star is the standing example, where column scope can answer for the star ban and the statement is
still refused, by the wrong gate, for the wrong reason. So every refusal names the
`guardrail.RULE_*` symbol it expects and takes its `reason` from `guardrail.REASON_FOR_RULE`, which
keeps the contract's enum the only source of the pairing.

The governed vectors are the other half and they are not decoration: they are what stops a
tightening from buying safety by refusing valid SQL. Each asserts `ok`, the ABSENCE of a refusal,
and a receipt carrying every declared section — iterated off `guardrail.Receipt.SECTIONS` so a
section added to the contract is covered here the day it lands.

#   * `model_unavailable` needs a deployment with no resolvable model, which is a configuration

#   * `audit_unavailable` needs a deployment whose audit store will not open, likewise a
#     configuration. Covered by `test_safety_envelope.py` on the package surface and by
#     `test_vendored_surface_parity.py` on the plugin's.
#   * `engine_mismatch` is covered by NOTHING yet. It is named here rather than quietly folded into
#     the corpus because an exemption with a reason is a known gap and an unnamed one is an
#     accident: it fires when the model's declared `storage_type` disagrees with the engine the
#     credentials connect to, which every harness build is careful to keep in step — so provoking it
#     means building a deliberately mismatched model, which no test does.
#   * `datasource_required` (#327) is decided from the call, not the statement: an omitted
#     `datasource` on an organization serving more than one. Every vector here names its datasource
#     on one fixture. Covered by `tests/test_datasource_routing.py`.
