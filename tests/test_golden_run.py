"""Running a golden dataset: what reaches the generator, what reaches the warehouse, what is scored.

A golden run asks a model to answer a question the answer to which is already agreed, runs both
statements, and scores one against the other. Two properties decide whether the resulting number
means anything at all, and neither is visible in the score:

* **The generating context must never hold the answer key.** A model that can see `expected.sql`
  is grading itself, and every assertion over the scores would still pass. The isolation is
  structural — the generator is handed a question and nothing else — so the tests below assert
  over what the generator was GIVEN rather than over what it returned.
* **The generating context must never hold a result row.** Generation strictly precedes execution,
  so there is no row in existence to leak at the moment the generator is called; these tests pin
  that ordering by looking for the rows afterwards.

Everything here stubs the generator, so nothing spends a token or needs a client installed. The
fixtures are synthetic throughout — an `acme` profile over `orders`, fabricated ids and totals.
