"""A golden run end to end: a dataset on disk, a real model, a real database, real rows.

Every other test of the runner stubs something. This one stubs only the model — the part that would
cost a token — and runs everything else for real: the reader parses a dataset file, both statements
go through `execute_guarded` against the shipped sample store database, the comparator scores what
SQLite actually returned, and the statement comparator reads both statements in SQLite's own
grammar.

That is what makes it worth its runtime. A unit test asserts each seam in isolation and would still
pass if two of them disagreed about the shape they exchange — a match level the comparator names
differently from the reader, a dialect the claim reader cannot parse, a score that does not survive
`json.dumps`. This one fails instead.

The sample store is synthetic and ships with this repository, so nothing here names real data.
