    Three separate review rounds found defects in this block, every one a combination the in-repo
    caller never produces: an `error_kind` alone defaulting to success, `raised` flipped by an
    unrelated `row_count`, a stated kind discarded by a contradictory success. Each was fixed with a
    test for that case, and the next case slipped through the same way — because the matrix was
    written from the cases already thought of.

    So this asserts the three properties that must hold for EVERY input instead:
      1. a successful row never carries an error kind;
      2. a call that raised is never logged as a success;
      3. an explicitly stated error kind is never silently replaced on a failed row;
      4. naming an error kind, without also claiming success, produces a FAILED row.

    Property 4 is the one that matters most and was the last to be written down. The other three are
    all satisfied by turning a stated error into `success=1, error_kind=NULL` — which is perfectly
    coherent, and is exactly the first bug found here. Coherence alone is not honesty: a row can
    contradict itself, or it can quietly agree with itself about the wrong thing.
