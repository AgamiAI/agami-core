"""The golden-dataset explorer: what the page says a dataset IS, before any run.

`render_golden_datasets.py` walks every golden dataset for a profile, reads the model the way the
model explorer does, and writes one self-contained HTML page. It decides nothing about a run — the
verdicts it shows were written down by AH-110 — so every assertion here is about what reached the
page and what could not.

The page builds its DOM from an embedded JSON payload, so — as in the sibling renderers' tests —
what is asserted is that payload and the template's own literal markup.
