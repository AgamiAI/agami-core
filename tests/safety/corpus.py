"""The F9 safety regression corpus — the adversarial vectors and the demo schema they run against.

One place defines two things:

  * `SCHEMA` — the demo model/datasource, from which the harness derives BOTH the semantic model
    (the `Datasource` the gates scope against) AND the physical warehouse (the SQLite/Postgres
    tables the governed queries actually execute against). Single-sourced so the model and the
    warehouse cannot describe different tables.
  * `CASES` — every attack class mapped to the outcome the chokepoint must produce for it.

`Case.rule` holds a `guardrail.RULE_*` **symbol**, never a string literal, and `None` means the
vector is governed and must come back `ok`. `reason` is deliberately NOT stored: it is asserted as
`guardrail.REASON_FOR_RULE[case.rule]`, so the contract's own enum stays the single source and a
vector cannot pin a reason the enum disagrees with.

There is no `max_rows` field. The per-call row cap was deleted with the truncate-and-flag arm, so
the availability class is driven by the deployment ceiling `AGAMI_SQL_MAX_ROWS` that the harness
sets on the server process. Porting the field would have reintroduced a knob that no longer exists.

`red_on_main` marks a vector whose expected outcome this branch does not produce yet. Those are
`xfail(strict=True)` at the driver, so they flip green on their own when the owning gate lands and
a premature "fix" cannot hide in them. Each one is MEASURED — run through the model gates on this
branch — rather than assumed by group.

**No vector is currently marked, and that is asserted.** The table function and the comma-joined
VALUES were both red when this corpus was written; the gate that owns them merged while it was
being built, and the strict markers failed the suite on the rebase rather than absorbing the change
in silence. The driver asserts the red set is exactly empty, so a new red vector has to be declared
rather than blend in.
