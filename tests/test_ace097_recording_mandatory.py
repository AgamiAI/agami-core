"""Recording is mandatory: a served deployment that cannot write the audit row does not execute.

Principle 7 says every call is recorded, executed or refused. That is only true if a call which
cannot be recorded does not happen — and the ordering is what makes this a real change rather than a
tidier `except`. The audit write runs at the tool edge, AFTER the statement: `tools._record_execution`
is called from `tools._emit`, the serializer. So closing the swallows alone can only turn a lost
record into an exception on a statement that already reached the customer's database.

This file pins the half that runs BEFORE execution:

  1. **The statement never runs.** With the store unopenable, `execute_guarded` returns
     `refused` / `audit_unavailable` and the executor is never called — asserted for the in-process
     path with a spy, and for the subprocess path by the warehouse file never coming into existence.
  2. **Local is untouched.** `governance-principles.md` scopes the principles to the served
     deployment, and locally there is no store to reach. A laptop with no `AGAMI_DB_URL` still
     answers.
  3. **The refusal is shaped like its sibling.** `audit_unavailable` is a deployment-state rule, so
     it reads `undetermined`, carries a value-free detail, and gets the before-the-model receipt —
     the gate runs above the semantic-model pass, so claiming "no model could be resolved" would be
     a different fact and an untrue one.

The store is broken with an UNSUPPORTED SCHEME rather than an unreachable host: `Store.connect`
raises on it deterministically, with no driver installed and no network wait, and it is one of the
two causes `_record_query`'s own docstring names (a malformed DSN, an uninstalled driver).
