"""Scopability gate: fail-closed when a query passes read-only but can't be fully scoped.

The object-scope gates only reject the `exp.Table` sources they FIND, so a query whose FROM/JOIN
source isn't a plain named table — a table-function / `ROWS FROM` (empty-name Table), or a
`VALUES` / `UNNEST` / `LATERAL` node — or that doesn't parse at all, would silently ALLOW. This
gate closes that: `check_scopable` returns a safety `Verdict` (`unscopable_sql`) for those, and
`None` for anything the scope checks can resolve. Runs in the same `_model_safety` pass, so every
surface fails closed identically.
