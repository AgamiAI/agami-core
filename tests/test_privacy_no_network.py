Privacy invariant: NO shipped script opens a connection of its own.

agami's promise is that nothing leaves your machine unless you asked for it. This
test is the automated backing for that claim: it scans every Python script that
ships in the plugin and fails the build if any of them references a network-egress
primitive.

This docstring used to say "NO shipped script makes a network call", and that is
no longer the posture. `semantic_model/golden_run.py` starts the operator's OWN
AI client as a CHILD PROCESS to generate the SQL a golden-dataset eval grades —
their client, their account, an explicit command, and a child whose every tool,
MCP server and setting source is switched off BY A FLAG (`--tools ""`,
`--strict-mcp-config`, `--setting-sources ""`), started in an empty directory,
with an allowlisted environment. Being out of process, it matches
none of the primitives below, so nothing here went red when it landed. That is
exactly why the wording is corrected deliberately: a doc that keeps promising what
the code stopped doing is worse than one that never promised it. What the scan
still holds, and what the product still promises, is that there is no in-process
network CLIENT — nothing agami ships opens a socket itself.

What's allowed and why:
  - `urllib.parse` — pure string parsing of DSNs (execute_sql.py). NOT network.
  - DB drivers (psycopg2 / pymysql / snowflake.connector / google.cloud.bigquery)
    — these connect to *your own* database/warehouse, which is the whole point of
    local execution. They are imported lazily inside execute_sql.py and are not
    arbitrary-host egress.

What's forbidden: generic outbound HTTP/socket/mail primitives that could
exfiltrate data to an arbitrary host. If you ever genuinely need one, you are
almost certainly building the hosted product, not the local plugin — and this
test should make you stop and think.

(This replaces the old tests/test_telemetry_privacy.py, which pinned the payload
allowlist of a telemetry sender that has since been removed entirely.)
