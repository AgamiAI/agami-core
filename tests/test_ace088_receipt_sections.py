"""The five declared receipt sections: what each one establishes, and what it admits it did not.

ACE-088 reshapes `runtime.assemble_receipt` around `guardrail.Receipt.SECTIONS`: `columns`,
`tables`, `joins`, `aggregates`, `assumptions`, each `{items, undetermined}`. The property under
test is not "the sections exist" but that the four states of a section stay distinguishable. An
empty list with no marker means "checked, found nothing", and an empty list WITH one means "not
checked, and here is why". Before this, both were the empty list and silence read as clean.

The sections are the assembler's TOP-LEVEL keys and they are the whole of what it returns, beside
the `model_version` pin. They were briefly nested under a `sections` key beside a parallel set of
flat ones (`tables_used`, `relationships`, `metrics`, `named_filters`, `warnings`, `sql`), because
`assumptions` named both a flat list and a section and one dict could not hold both. Deleting the
flat keys removed the collision; `test_the_receipt_is_the_sections_and_the_version_pin` is what
keeps a flat key from coming back.

    give the same answer about the same statement.

    BOTH assemblers, because there are two and the fix reached one. `assemble_refusal_receipt` kept
    computing `declared` from the RAW name against an index keyed by `_tkey`, and it is the one that
    matters most: on a refusal, `declared` is the ONLY model fact the caller is given.
    `SELECT ref_no FROM ORDERS` refuses with `column_scope` — so the table gate resolved `ORDERS`
    fine — while its receipt said `{"ref": "ORDERS", "declared": false}`.

    compared the model's own names against the UNFOLDED set of names the statement wrote, so a folded
    statement reported both tables in scope AND no declared join between them — the receipt stating
    that the model declares no relationship where the model declares one.

    The fold moved with the section, in both of the places the answer passes through. The endpoints
    of a written join go through `_tkey` before they are tested for membership, so `ORDERS` is a name
    the model could have a declaration about rather than one it could not — without that it would
    come back `undeclarable`, which is the same false claim in the new vocabulary and worse than the
    old one, because `undeclarable` is SETTLED and would not even be counted on the marker. Then the
    matching normalizes both sides as `_tkey(bare_name(...))`, so the declaration is found and the
    join reads `declared` rather than merely being left open.

    The label is still the caller's own spelling: the status is the claim, and the label is the
    address a reader finds the join by in their own SQL.
