"""ACE-083 — the shapes a soundness fix may never report clean, pinned before any fix lands.

ACE-083 makes the multiplication report say what a join actually multiplies. Three of its four
corrections are LOOSENINGS: an aggregate a duplication cannot move stops being called a trap, a
many-side column that is not on the value path stops attributing the fan, and a reference the
statement cannot see stops entering the alias map. Each one narrows what gets reported, and the
whole existing battery guards the other direction — every shipped assertion says "this IS reported"
and not one of them says "this is still not reported clean".

That asymmetry is the hazard. A loosening that goes one step too far turns a genuinely inflated
number into `not_multiplied`, which is a positive claim on the receipt that the number is sound.
Nothing on `main` fails when that happens. So the reverse corpus lands FIRST, in its own file,
before a line of production code moves.

Almost every member of the reverse corpus passes on the base implementation, and that is the point:
those are not the tests for the new behaviour, they are the tests for the behaviour that must
survive it. Three members do fail on base — the unaliased `VALUES` list and the two set operations
whose CTE is bound above the arms — and each of those was a false clean measured on base while this
slice was being built, so they are corpus members and regression tests at once. The batteries below
the corpus are the per-slice tests of what each correction actually changed, and they land beside it
rather than in files of their own so that a loosening and the pins guarding it are read together.

The corpus rows carry the ITEMS each statement is known to inflate rather than only the SQL, because
the property asserted over every aggregate in a statement can only hold members every one of whose
arms is inflated. That shut out the mixed statements — one sound number beside one unsound one —
that most real multi-aggregate SQL is, and a rule that suppresses per STATEMENT rather than per ITEM
is invisible until one of those is in the corpus.

Slice 2 (S1) is here: an aggregate a duplication cannot move keeps the multiplication and loses the
word trap, and the marker sentence that reported the detector's old shortcoming is deleted.

Slice 3 (S2) is here: the fan is attributed by where a column sits on the aggregate's VALUE path
rather than by its presence anywhere inside the aggregate.

Slices 4 and 5 (S3) are here, and they are ONE commit rather than two. The scope filter and the
grain plumbing were planned as separate slices; they cannot be, and the corpus is what proved it.
The filter stops a reference written inside a CTE body from entering the outer query's map, which
is correct and is half of S3 — but `CTE_LAUNDERED_FAN` reported `multiplied` at HEAD only BECAUSE
of that leak, and with the leak gone and no resolution for what `oi` stands for, a genuinely
inflated statement read `not_multiplied`. The intermediate state fails the corpus's own criterion,
so it is not a legal place to stop.

The last battery in this file is the one two independent re-reviews arrived at from opposite ends,
and it is one root cause rather than several. `_value_sources` and `_grain_preserving_source` were
both DENYLISTS with an unsafe default: one enumerated the alternation node types and let every other
node union its children, the other rejected three `exp.Select` arguments and accepted the rest, and
in both an unanticipated shape landed on the side that CLEARS a finding. Seven statements were
measured `not_multiplied` through those two holes — four of them ordinary Snowflake / Redshift /
Oracle analytics SQL — and they are corpus members above rather than a corpus of their own, because
the property they violate is the one this file already asserts.

    is a false statement on the receipt about a correct statement, and the cost of it is the one
    that matters: a reader who is told a sound number was inflated learns to discount the report.

    The analysis reaches most of these branches, but it reaches them in combination and reports one
    status per statement, so a branch that dropped a table the value does use and a branch that kept
    one it does not can cancel out in the answer. Called directly, each shape says which tables it
    thinks the value is built from, and a wrong one is wrong visibly.

    The guard branches are the reason this is a unit test at all. A simple `CASE`'s operand
    (`CASE orders.status WHEN 'x' THEN …`) is an input to the branch CHOICE, not to the result, so
    it belongs with the `WHEN` predicates and not with the `THEN` values — and it lives under
    `Case.this`, which the generic branch would have taken. The nested case proves the recursion
    applies the same rule at depth rather than only at the top. `DISTINCT` is the opposite check:
    it carries a genuine value column under `args["expressions"]`, so the generic branch must reach
    it and no case may intercept it.

    The alternation cases are what an earlier reading of this function got wrong. Reading a `CASE`
    as the UNION of its branches puts a many-side column on the value path whenever ANY branch
    carries one, so a value that is a one-side amount on the rows where the predicate holds reads as
    though it were at many-side grain throughout — and the fan that really does duplicate those rows
    is cleared. `IF` is the same defect with a sharper edge, because sqlglot parses `IF` / `IIF` /
    `IFF` to `exp.If` rather than to `exp.Case` and then RENDERS it back as `CASE WHEN … END`, so
    without a case of its own the two spellings produce a byte-identical receipt label carrying

    asserted here rather than assumed, because it is the premise of the whole question.

    But `cmd_preflight` and `cmd_prepare` in `semantic_model/cli.py` call `pre_flight_check`
    directly, with no gate battery at all — `cmd_prepare`'s own docstring says it is not a gate and
    never was — and the query skill runs `sm prepare` on every tier. On that surface both of these

    prepare receipt has no way to know a gate they never invoked would have refused the statement;
    what they have is the sentence in front of them, and it said the number was sound.

    So the analysis answers honestly on both surfaces, and the binding exists for the one that has
    no gate in front of it. `pre_flight_check` is called directly here for the same reason: driving

    section, so `_RECEIPT_MAX_REFS` truncates the items and COUNTS what it dropped on the marker,
