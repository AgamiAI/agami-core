"""
Tests for `sql_guard` — the hardened read-only / dangerous-SQL gate shared by the
stdio server, the HTTP/OAuth server, the agami-query skill, and cron.

Two things are pinned here:

  1. **Security.** Every write / DDL / transaction-control / session-state /
     dangerous-function / multi-statement / comment-or-quote-bypass vector is
     rejected — including the vectors that historically bypassed naive guards
     (comment-in-string, PG-quoted function names, comment-welded word boundaries).

  2. **No false positives.** A large corpus of the analytics SQL an assistant emits
     every day MUST pass. Over-tightening the deny-list silently degrades every
     query, so this corpus is the primary safety net.

Bare `pg_catalog` / `information_schema` / environment-introspection blocking is a
deferred follow-up (see `test_known_deferred_gaps_currently_pass` for the pinned
current behavior).

`sql_guard.check_read_only` returns None (safe) or a `guardrail.Refusal` (rejected).

Every reject corpus below is a module-level constant rather than an inline literal in its
`@pytest.mark.parametrize`. That is what lets `test_ace035_read_only_refusal.py` assert the refusal
contract over the WHOLE corpus by importing it, instead of copying ~150 strings into a second file
where the two would drift apart the first time a vector is added here.
