"""`thread_id` promoted to a required input, and the flag that gates it.

`thread_id` groups a conversation's calls and is entirely self-reported: `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` asks
for it on every call and ends "Best-effort; omit if unknown". Models take the omission — measured on
one deployment across two consecutive conversations, 2 of 10 calls carried one and then 0 of 8. With
the property marked required the same client sent it on 9 of 9.

These tests hold the SHAPE of the change and the default. Whether a model populates a required field
is not something a unit test can decide, and the flag exists precisely because that has to be
observed on a real client rather than asserted here.
