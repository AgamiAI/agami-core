"""Adversarial suite for the table-scope guard.

Each case is an attempt to reach a table the model does not declare by a route other than
naming it in a bare `FROM`. `test_table_scope_gate.py` is the happy path plus the documented
degrades; a green happy-path suite does NOT prove the gate holds against evasion — these do.
The column-scope and star gates have had this since #93; table scope had nothing, which is
what ACE-096 found.

Cases fall into three groups, mirroring `test_column_scope_adversarial.py`:

  * scope evasion               -> must refuse (rule: table_scope)
  * documented accepted allow   -> asserts *allow*, so a future narrowing of the boundary is
                                   a conscious, test-breaking decision
  * upstream-owned              -> asserts a different layer already catches it

**These lock, they do not close.** Every refusal below already holds on the base commit, and
that is the point: this gate is the whole of principle 4b's table half and had no statement of
intended behaviour for a reviewer to check a change against. The one route that genuinely does
NOT hold today is dialect-specific quoting, and it lives in `test_parse_fidelity_gaps.py` as
expected-fail rather than here, so the two kinds of case are never confused for each other.

The gate returns `guardrail.Refusal | None`, so "must refuse" reads `is not None` and "accepted
allow" reads `is None`. The rule id is asserted on every refusal: an evasion caught by the WRONG
gate would otherwise pass as if this one held.
