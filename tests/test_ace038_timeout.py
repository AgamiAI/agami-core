"""Per-statement timeout — config resolution, the deadline primitive, and the refusal it produces.

`_resolve_timeout_s` answers "how long may one statement run", from `AGAMI_SQL_TIMEOUT_S` and a 30s
default and from nothing else — one configuration surface, so the parent and the forked child reach
the same number. Unlike the row cap it complains out loud whenever the budget it returns is not the
one the operator wrote, whether the text was unreadable or merely declined. `_deadline` is the
watchdog those seconds feed: it fires an Event and calls a cancel callable when a block outlives its
budget, and disarms cleanly when it does not — where "cleanly" means the disarm is a JOIN, so a
watchdog that loses the race lands nowhere at all.

The second half of this file proves the whole contract end to end on ONE engine — SQLite, chosen
because it is in-process, needs no network, and `sqlite3.Connection.interrupt()` is a genuine cancel
rather than a polite request. A statement that outlives its budget is cancelled, unwinds on the
internal `_ResourceLimit` marker, and leaves `execute_guarded` as a `refused` Envelope carrying
`resource_limit` — with no partial data, a detail that quotes the configured budget, and a
remediation addressed to whoever can actually act on it.

What no test here can show is that the cancel reached a SERVER: SQLite is in-process, and on a
client/server engine an abandoned statement produces the identical Envelope while the backend keeps
running. That assertion needs a live database and a second connection, and lives in
`test_postgres_timeout_integration.py`, which skips unless one is configured.

**The classification is the FLAG, and only the flag.** A cancelled SQLite statement raises
`OperationalError("interrupted")`, so neither the error text nor the elapsed clock can be the test:
both are properties an ordinary database error can have by coincidence, and reading either one would
mean an unlucky query gets told to narrow itself when nothing timed out. `_deadline` sets its Event
*before* the cancel lands, so "did WE stop this?" is answerable without inference — and it is
asserted here in both directions.

The last section is the OUTER bound, which is what makes the limit apply to every executor rather
than to the built-in one alone. An injected executor (the hosted connection-reuse path) carries none
of the engine watchdogs, and even the built-in BigQuery path has no cancel to arm — so
`execute_guarded` bounds `executor.execute` itself, on a worker thread it can stop waiting for. The
four bounds are one ordered family (watchdog < native < outer < supervisor) resolved from one budget,
and the order is asserted as a single fact so no future change can let them drift apart.
