"""A database error is classified from driver text that never crosses the boundary.

The failure channel was the one place the model could still leak. A guardrail refusal is
built from static prose and echoes only what the caller sent; `failure.message` was relayed
from the driver verbatim, and PostgreSQL volunteers declared column names in a `HINT`.

Classifying FROM driver text is not the same as returning it. The output is one of a fixed
set of labels and the caller receives `_ERROR_MESSAGES[kind]`, so the caller still learns
enough to act (a missing column is not a syntax error) while learning nothing about the
schema.

Two properties here are easy to get wrong and silent when wrong:

* **The authored/driver split.** Codes 2 and 3 are text this module wrote and must keep being
  relayed, or an operator loses the one line telling them to set `DATASOURCE_URL`. Codes 4
  and 5 carry the driver's exception and must not be.
* **Fork parity.** The child classifies correctly and encodes the kind as an exit code. A
  test that only exercises the in-process path cannot see the default surface being wrong.
