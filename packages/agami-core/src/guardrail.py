"""The shared guardrail contract — one `Refusal`, one `Envelope`, every surface.

Every SQL safety gate returns `Refusal | None`; every path through `execute_sql.execute_guarded`
returns an `Envelope`. So a caller never has to know WHICH gate fired to understand what happened,
and a decision we made is never confused with a failure the database reported.

**Stdlib only, dataclasses only, and 3.9-compatible.** Imported at runtime by `sql_guard`,
`execute_sql` and `semantic_model.runtime`, and vendored byte-identical into
`plugins/agami/lib/guardrail.py` for the marketplace layout (no pip, no package, no deps). It
therefore may not import pydantic, `contracts`, or anything outside the stdlib — pinned by the
clean-subprocess check in `tests/test_ports.py`. The 3.9 floor is separate and applies to this
module and the rest of the vendored slice only: the *package* requires 3.10+, but the plugin mirror
runs on whatever `python3` the user already has, which on stock macOS is 3.9.6. So no `match`, no
3.10-only dataclass keyword (`kw_only`, `slots`), and `X | None` only inside annotations, which
`from __future__ import annotations` keeps as lazy strings. Pinned by
`tests/test_plugin_lib_resolution.py::test_the_vendored_slice_stays_python_39_compatible`.
`Envelope.data` is an `ExecResult`, referenced under TYPE_CHECKING only: the same device
`ports.Executor` uses, for the same two reasons — dependency-freedom, and no runtime import cycle
(`execute_sql` imports THIS module).

"""Eleven classified operational errors declared.

Produced today: `dsn`, `driver_missing`, `auth` and `syntax` from the executor's classified exit
codes, `other` from its catch-all, `timeout` from the subprocess supervisor at the tool edge —
the bound that kills a forked executor which never returned — and `sign_in_required` from an
injected executor only (below).

**`sign_in_required` is produced only by an injected executor** that connects as the person asking
(a per-user credential exchange, for instance). It means the person's own credential is missing or
could no longer be renewed, so the fix is theirs: sign in again. It is not `auth`, whose fix is an
operator's re-credential, and reporting it as `auth` made a client tell a person the warehouse was
broken when a fresh sign-in was all it took.

**`timeout` is a failure, not a refusal, and whose decision it was is not the test on its own.** The
supervisor bound is ours, but it cannot attribute the kill to the STATEMENT: the child may have hung
in connect, credential resolution or model load, where "narrow the query" is the wrong fix. So an
unresponsive executor is `failed` / `timeout`, and its message says only that we stopped waiting
(guardrail contract §3). A **per-statement** timeout is the other case — its subject IS the
statement, so it is a refusal carrying `RULE_RESOURCE_LIMIT`, and the executor now imposes one: a
watchdog cancels the statement through the driver and the outcome leaves the chokepoint on the
refusal channel rather than this one. The two therefore coexist and stay distinguishable in the audit
trail, which is the whole point of splitting them. Driver-level connect/login timeouts fold into the
connect failure the executor already reports as `auth` (exit 4), because that is what the driver
raises.

`column_not_found`, `table_not_found`, `permission` and `network` are DECLARED BUT UNREACHABLE:
producing them means parsing driver text, and sanitizing driver text belongs to the error-hardening
slice. Declared now so those slices fill a member rather than widen the type.

**`permission` is a failure kind, not the `read_only` rule** (contract §3). `read_only` is §1's
verdict that we blocked a write; `permission` is the database refusing a READ to the connection's
role, and it stays distinct from `auth` because the credentials were accepted — the operator action
is a grant, not a re-credential. The two were one word until 2026-07-30, which left an audit row
unable to say which had happened. ACE-039 produces it."""
