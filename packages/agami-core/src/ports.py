"""The five port Protocols — the seams adapters plug into.

agami-core keeps one MCP implementation across deployments; deployment-specific behavior is
swapped at the composition root through these ports, never by forking a tool:

  - ``ActivitySink``     — where query-execution records go (file by default)
  - ``OrgResolver``      — single vs multi tenancy as a config flag, not a schema fork
  - ``AuthProvider``     — bearer token → principal (presence by default)
  - ``GovernancePolicy`` — warn-only by default; enforcement is a paid concern
  - ``Executor``         — the connect-and-run step, *behind* the shared guard (built-in by default;
                           a consumer injects a pooled/RBAC/tunnel executor without forking the guard)

These are **interfaces only** — `typing.Protocol`, so an adapter satisfies a port by shape, with
no import coupling back to core. The OSS default adapters live in ``oss_adapters`` (so the local
product runs out of the box); a downstream consumer supplies its own.

The seam value types (``Org`` / ``Principal`` / ``GovernanceVerdict``) are stdlib dataclasses, not
pydantic models, so this module imports with **zero dependencies** — a consumer can depend on the
seams without pulling the model deps. The wire shapes that need validation (the 4-tool I/O) live
in ``contracts`` (pydantic). Each type is kept minimal — only what a default adapter or a
consumer needs.
