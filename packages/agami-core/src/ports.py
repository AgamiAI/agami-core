"""The four port Protocols — the seams adapters plug into.

agami-core keeps one MCP implementation across deployments; deployment-specific behavior is
swapped at the composition root through these ports, never by forking a tool:

  - ``ActivitySink``     — where query-execution records go (file by default)
  - ``OrgResolver``      — single vs multi tenancy as a config flag, not a schema fork
  - ``AuthProvider``     — bearer token → principal (presence by default)
  - ``Executor``         — the connect-and-run step, *behind* the shared guard (built-in by default;
                           a consumer injects a pooled/RBAC/tunnel executor without forking the guard)

These are **interfaces only** — `typing.Protocol`, so an adapter satisfies a port by shape, with
no import coupling back to core. The OSS default adapters live in ``oss_adapters`` (so the local
product runs out of the box); a downstream consumer supplies its own.

The seam value types (``Org`` / ``Principal``) are stdlib dataclasses, not
pydantic models, so this module imports with **zero dependencies** — a consumer can depend on the
seams without pulling the model deps. The wire shapes that need validation (the 4-tool I/O) live
in ``contracts`` (pydantic). Each type is kept minimal — only what a default adapter or a
consumer needs.

    logging, or governance itself. This is the seam a hosted consumer overrides to supply a
    pooled / per-user-RBAC / SSH-tunnel executor **behind agami-core's one guard** — no fork.

    ``profile`` is the datasource identity a pooling executor keys its reused connection on. The
    built-in OSS default (subprocess/direct connect-per-query) implements this same shape, so a
    plain deploy is unchanged.

    Returns:
        An ``ExecResult``. Returning ``None`` (or anything else) is a contract violation and is
        reported to the caller as ``failed`` / ``other`` — never as a successful empty result.

    Raises:
        ``execute_sql.ExecutorError`` for a connect / credential / driver / run failure. That is the
        classified channel: its ``code`` picks the ``Failure.kind`` the caller sees. Its ``msg`` is
        relayed only for the authored codes 2 and 3; for every other code the caller gets the fixed
        sentence for the kind, and ``msg`` goes to the audit detail and the server log only. An
        adapter that wants a specific kind raises this with that kind's code, looked up in
        ``execute_sql.FAILURE_KIND_TO_EXIT`` (``sign_in_required`` when the asking person's own
        credential is missing or cannot be renewed). Use ``.get(kind, 4)`` for a kind an older core
        may not have, so the failure stays classified.

        Any **other** exception is caught by ``execute_guarded`` and becomes ``failed`` / ``other``
        with a generic, value-free message; the raw text and stack go to the server log only. So a
        pooled executor's own ``PoolError`` is safe to raise — it will not escape the chokepoint and
        it will not skip the audit row — but it will not reach the caller either. Prefer
        ``ExecutorError``."""
