"""
The shared MCP tool registry + implementations — one impl, both transports.

`TOOLS` (name → {handler, description, inputSchema}) is the single source both the stdio
entrypoint (`mcp_harness`) and the HTTP entrypoint (`mcp_http`) advertise, so a client sees the
same surface and behavior whether it connects over stdio (Claude Desktop) or HTTP (claude.ai).

The surface is the **4 product tools**: `list_datasources`, `get_datasource_schema` (adaptive),
`get_prompt_examples`, `execute_sql`.

Design constraints (match the rest of agami):
  - The execute_sql tool is pure-stdlib. The model-backed tools import the
    `semantic_model` package (Pydantic) lazily and surface a clear "install the model deps" error
    if it's absent — so execution still works on a bare install.
  - **No data leaves the machine.** SQL is executed locally by shelling out to `execute_sql` (the
    same executor the skills use), which runs the fan/chasm pre-flight + default_filters safety
    pass; the semantic model is read from `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`.
