"""
The shared MCP tool registry + implementations — one impl, both transports.

`TOOLS` (name → {handler, description, inputSchema}) is the single source both the stdio
entrypoint (`mcp_harness`) and the HTTP entrypoint (`mcp_http`) advertise, so a client sees the
same surface and behavior whether it connects over stdio (Claude Desktop) or HTTP (claude.ai).

The surface is the **4 product tools**: `list_datasources`, `get_datasource_schema` (adaptive),
`get_prompt_examples`, `execute_sql`.

Design constraints (match the rest of agami):
  - The execute_sql tool is pure-stdlib. The model-backed tools import the
    `semantic_model` package (Pydantic) lazily and surface a clear "install the model deps" error
    if it's absent — so execution still works on a bare install.
  - **No data leaves the machine.** SQL is executed locally by shelling out to `execute_sql` (the
    same executor the skills use), which runs the scope gates and reports the fan/chasm and
    aggregation findings on the receipt; the model is read from `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`.

    "you need to write the SQL). (2) Examples-first — call get_prompt_examples and mirror the "

    "metric `calculation`/`binding` verbatim. (3) execute_sql (the safety pass runs inside it; "
    "a table's declared `default_filters` are NOT applied — write one into the SQL yourself if "

    "fan the pair out per datasource rather than walking them one at a time.\n"

    "rather than translating it — but the rest of the statement is yours to write in the right "
    "one, and date arithmetic, string functions and casts are where a guess shows up.\n"
    "The receipt is on EVERY status execute_sql returns, and execute_sql's own description defines "
    "its five sections — columns, tables, joins, aggregates, assumptions — field by field, "
    "including what each status value means. Read it there. What belongs here is what you DO with "

    "definitions they have not signed off, and you never hide one. (b) Don't refuse on an "
    "unreviewed metric — answer and warn. (c) Surface a section's `undetermined` sentence whenever "
    "it is non-null: it is the difference between checked-and-clean and not-checked, because an "
    "empty `items` with that marker set means NOT CHECKED while an empty `items` with a null "
    "marker means checked and clean. Reporting only `items` turns 'not checked' back into "
    "'nothing wrong', which is the one reading the receipt exists to prevent. (d) An `omitted` "
    "filter (`receipt.tables.items[].filters`), a `multiplied` aggregate and an `unmatched` output "

    "writing a correction back into the semantic model or the example library is an agami skill "
    "operation, not an MCP call. So apply a correction within this conversation and say plainly "
    "that it is not persisted. Never tell the user you have remembered or saved something you "

    "PII: a column marked `sensitive: true` is the model author asking you to handle it with care. "

    "'unique emails' → COUNT(DISTINCT email) — and to disambiguate identical labels, project the "
    "non-sensitive id. Nothing stops you: this is judgement, not a gate, and the receipt reports "
    "which sensitive columns an answer projected. Project them when the question genuinely needs "
    "them and say that you did. A column that must not be readable at all is not in the model, and "
    "a statement naming it is refused as out-of-scope.\n"
    "Activity log: on EVERY tool call (not just execute_sql), pass a `thread_id` (one per conversation, "
    "reused across all its calls) and a `correlation_id` (one per user question/turn, reused across the "
    "calls answering it, fresh when they ask something new), plus `user_question` (the user's question "
    "VERBATIM — keep it the SAME across the calls answering it; on execute_sql your own refinement goes "

# version pin. Keyed inside by profile, and scoped to a request rather than to the process, for two
# different reasons that both matter.
#
# **Cost.** `_model_version` is not free where it counts. Hosted, it opens a fresh unpooled psycopg2
# connection, queries and closes it — and a single `ok` call reached it five times (once inside each
# of the three `get_cached_org` calls, twice more directly), so one query cost up to five new Postgres
# connections for one unchanging string.
#
# **Correctness.** A version that changes mid-request would otherwise let one answer be described by
# two different model versions. Resolving once per request makes "the receipt pins the model this
# answer used" true by construction rather than by the two reads happening to race the same way.
#
# The assembled receipt was memoized here too, because the legacy flat dict and the Envelope's typed
# `Receipt` were assembled separately from the same statement. There is one receipt now and one
# consumer of it, so the memo has nothing left to absorb and the property it delivered — one
# assembly per request — is pinned by a test on both routes instead of by a cache that hides a
# second call site.

    at the process boundary — on exactly the refused and failed outcomes. Building it here is what
    keeps the two paths saying the same thing about the same statement, without changing the wire
    format between parent and child (ACE-035 declined to scope that).

    `bounded` picks the echo-bounded assembler, and EVERY non-ok outcome asks for it — the same rule
    the chokepoint's `_receipt_for` states and for the same reason: a `failed` body is reachable for a
    name the model declares and the warehouse does not have, so it is a disclosure channel of its own
    rather than a subset of `ok`'s.

    A build that raises returns an `undetermined` receipt, never `None`. A receipt that could not be
    built is a fact the caller can act on ("the model deps are not installed here"); `None` was an
    absence the caller could only read as silence. The two failure reasons are kept apart here
    exactly as the chokepoint keeps them apart, and they are the chokepoint's own constants: a caller
    on the default fork path would otherwise never see the actionable one, which is this spec's own
    defect one layer down.

    CLOSED GAP, and this is where it lived. `sql` here is the statement the CALLER sent, which is the
    only one this side of the fork has: `_model_safety` runs in the child, so anything it rewrote
    rebound the child's local before it executed and this described a statement that did not run.

    It closed by subtraction rather than by plumbing the rewritten statement back across the wire.
    The default-filter injection went first, then the fan/chasm auto-rewrite, and nothing rewrites a
    statement now — the string below is the one the child executes, byte for byte, and
    tests/test_ace093_byte_identity.py asserts that at the driver hand-off. The parity this depended
    on is measured in tests/test_ace088_executed_statement.py, which carried it as a `strict=True`
    xfail until the last rewrite went.

    Keep the invariant in mind before adding one back: a rewrite anywhere below the fork makes this

      * the exit code is one the child's CLI contract produces from a `Failure`
        (`execute_sql.EXIT_TO_FAILURE_KIND` — 2/3/4/5/6). Those are the codes `main` reaches by
        writing `env.failure.message`, so the text is something the child classified and chose. Any
        other code — a Python-level crash exiting 1, a signal, a code we do not know — means the
        child never got that far, so its stderr is whatever happened to be on the way out.
      * the text carries no Python traceback. Belt and braces on the rule above, and the concrete
        thing that used to land here: before `execute_guarded` was made total, a malformed
        credentials file raised `configparser.MissingSectionHeaderError` out of the child, and the
        parent put the whole traceback — absolute filesystem paths included — into `failure.message`,
        which is a field the caller is shown.

    What is deliberately still relayed is the child's *authored* config-error text ("No warehouse
    credentials for profile […]. Set DATASOURCE_URL…"). That is the remediation a misconfigured user
    needs, and it is the same text the in-process path surfaces from `ExecutorError.msg` — the two
    paths agreeing on it is a property this slice exists to keep.

    **The sanitized band is RECONSTRUCTED, never relayed (ACE-039).** For every code whose message
    the child derives from `_ERROR_MESSAGES`, the parent can rebuild that exact sentence from the
    exit code alone, so relaying stderr for those codes buys nothing and carries real risk: stderr
    is a *shared* stream, and the child writes to it before the failure line. The concrete case was
    `_model_safety`'s `[agami] applied default_filters: …` notice — it put a declared row-level
    predicate, which the caller never sent, into `failure.message` on the DEFAULT transport, while
    the in-process path returned the clean sentence. (That notice is gone: ACE-042 deleted the
    injection it announced, and the `[agami] auto-corrected …` notice that replaced it as the
    example went the same way with the rewrite it announced. What still writes to the child's stderr
    is anything a library logs: both surviving diagnostic lines went too, when ACE-094 deleted the
    refusals that wrote them. The reconstruction below is not thereby unnecessary — a library
    writing to the shared stream has exactly the same reach, and it is the mechanism rather than
    any one notice that keeps the caller's answer clean. The traceback guard only ever caught the
    two `exc_info=True` sites.)

    longer builds a receipt of its own. It used to nest one here — the flat assembler output, under
    `data.receipt` — beside the Envelope's typed `guardrail.Receipt`, so one answer carried two
    descriptions of itself that were free to disagree and only the nested one reached an `ok`
    caller. There is one receipt now, it hangs off the Envelope, and `_emit` puts it on all three
    statuses.

    It no longer writes the audit row either. This function only ever runs on success, so hanging the
    write here is precisely why a refusal left no trace; the write moved to `_emit`, which every
    outcome passes through. Shaping a payload and recording an execution were two jobs in one place —
    and the `args` parameter went with the write, since the tool arguments were only ever read for
    the log."""

    Collapsing the six previous `json.dumps` return sites into this one is the point of the slice: a
    refusal now reads the same whether the guard ran in-process or in a forked child, because there
    is only one place that decides how a refusal reads.

    Per status:
      * `ok`      — `_finalize_execution`'s frozen payload with `status`, `receipt` and `audit_id`
                    merged on. Its rows are textualized here (`None` → `""`, else `str`) so both

      * `failed`  — `{status, failure, sql?, execution_ms?, receipt, audit_id}`.

    The receipt is attached AFTER the branch, once, for all three — so `Envelope.receipt` is the
    only receipt a caller can read and there is no per-status decision about whether it appears. It
    rode the two non-ok bodies only while the `ok` payload owned a `"receipt"` key of its own (the
    flat legacy dict), because splatting the payload would have silently overwritten one of the two.

    `None` fields are omitted rather than emitted as explicit `null`, so a response never carries a

    must not break the tool and is warned about. Served, principle 7 makes the row part of the call:

    The trailing parameters are an **override seam for an embedder that dispatches tool handlers
    itself** rather than through this package's transport. Each defaults to `None`, meaning *derive it
    the way this function always has* — so a caller that passes none of them gets byte-identical rows.

    Two groups, for two different reasons:

    - `source` / `thread_id` / `correlation_id` / `user_question` replace values that are otherwise read
      out of `arguments`, i.e. **self-reported by the model**. A caller that observed them directly can
      state them authoritatively, and the model can no longer influence how its own calls are grouped.
    - `success` / `row_count` / `error_kind` replace values otherwise **derived here by parsing
      `result_text`**. A caller that already classified the outcome passes it rather than handing over a
      result body to be re-parsed — and, more importantly, one that has *no* body to hand over can still
      record a failure. Without these, an outcome this function cannot see defaults to success, which is
      the one direction an audit log must never fail in. They are applied **as a group, and forced to
      be coherent**: state any one and the derived trio is replaced wholesale; an `error_kind` with no
      explicit `success` reads as a failure rather than defaulting to success; and a success never
      carries an error kind. So no combination of these arguments can write a row that says
      "succeeded" beside an error. **`raised=True` outranks all of them** — a call that threw is a
      failure whatever the caller passes, though it may still be given a more specific kind than the
      generic `"exception"`.
    - `audit_id` replaces the execution id otherwise **read out of `result_text`** (019). Same reason
      as the trio above and one more: a caller with no body to hand over can still record which
      execution this call was, and unlike the trio it can state nothing incoherent, because an
      identity makes no claim about how the call went.
    - `org_id` replaces the tenant otherwise stamped downstream from this process's context. A caller
      that read the tenant at the point which actually scoped the work states it, rather than leaving it
      to be re-read later from a context that may no longer be the same one. The fallback when that
      read finds nothing is the deployment-wide org, and for an audit row that is the wrong direction
      to fail in.

    **What this fixes.** `thread_id` is what groups a conversation's calls, and it is entirely
    self-reported: the activity-log directive in `SERVER_INSTRUCTIONS` asks for it on every call and
    ends "Best-effort; omit if unknown". Models take the omission. Measured on one deployment across
    two consecutive conversations: 2 of 10 calls carried one, then 0 of 8 — not one, including the
    first. Calls without it group into no conversation, so an activity view either fragments them
    into singletons (this server's behaviour) or, for a consumer that filters them, loses them.

    **Why the schema rather than better wording.** The directive is prose on a surface where the
    CLIENT supplies the prompt, and it has now produced 20% and then 0% compliance. The input schema
    is the one channel the server controls: the MCP SDK validates `arguments` against `inputSchema`
    before dispatch, and a model populates a field marked required. Measured after the change on the
    same client: 9 of 9 calls carried it, with distinct per-turn `correlation_id`s.

    **Why it is flagged, and why the default is off.** That same validation is the risk. A call
    omitting a required property never reaches its handler — it returns "Input validation error". So
    this either works, or it takes the tool out of service for that client. There is no degraded
    middle, and the measured omission rate before the change was up to 100%. A deployment should turn
    it on somewhere observed, confirm calls still land, and only then roll it forward. Existing
    deployments and every other consumer of this registry are unaffected until they opt in.

    **Why not derive the id server-side instead.** There is nothing to derive it from. The OAuth
    `sid` identifies one *authorization* and survives token rotation by design, so it would file
    every conversation a user ever has under a single thread; and the streamable-HTTP transport runs
    `stateless=True`, so there is no `mcp-session-id` either. The server holds no per-conversation
    fact — which is why the directive asks the model for one.

    Copy-on-write and name-preserving: `TOOLS` itself is never mutated, so a process that builds more
    than one server (tests do) cannot leak the requirement into a registry that did not ask for it. A
    tool that declares no `thread_id` is passed through untouched rather than having the property
    invented for it — marking a non-existent property required would fail every call to that tool
