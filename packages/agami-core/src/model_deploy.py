The hosted server serves the model **from the database** (`tools._serve_model` reads the DB when one is
configured), so a deploy has to push the YAML model into Postgres. The read→write primitives already exist
and are idempotent; this is the orchestrator that wires them for every datasource under the artifacts dir.
Run by the deploy entrypoint and re-run on restart to pick up an edited model.
