"""Deciding whether two result sets say the same thing.

Canonical keys for the cells first, so two result sets can be compared at all.

A comparison asks whether the answer key's rows and the rows a generated statement produced say
the same thing. Doing that on the raw cells does not work, because the Python objects a driver
hands back are not the values a reader means:

* ``True == 1 == 1.0 == Decimal(1)`` and all four hash alike, so ``Counter`` collapses them into
  one bucket. A boolean column would compare equal to an integer column of zeros and ones, and
  the comparison would report a match it never checked.
* ``float('nan') != float('nan')``, yet dict's identity fast-path collapses the *same* NaN object
  anyway — so a row count would depend on whether the driver happened to reuse an object.
* ``Decimal('0.1') != 0.1``, because one is a decimal and the other the nearest binary float. The
  same number read through two drivers would disagree.

So every cell is first turned into a ``(type_tag, value)`` tuple: hashable, safely usable as a
``Counter`` key, and carrying the type distinction the raw value throws away. Values are
canonicalised only where two spellings genuinely mean one thing — a padded decimal, a date written
as text, a driver's ``'t'`` for true. Text itself is left exactly as it came: stripping or
case-folding would hide a real difference between two result sets, which is the one thing a
comparator must never do.

On top of those keys sits the comparison itself, in three steps that are deliberately separate:
whether the answer key asked for an ordering at all, which generated column answers which golden
one, and how far the rows agree once the columns are paired. Column identity is decided by VALUES
and never by name or position — a generated statement is free to alias a total and to select it
second — and rows are compared as a multiset unless the author ordered them, because duplicates
are signal and order usually is not.

``compare_result_sets`` is the one way in. It is TOTAL: a malformed result, an unreadable
statement or a band that cannot be applied all come back as a score with an error status, never as
an exception, so one bad item costs that item and not the run — the same posture
``execute_guarded`` takes and the same one ``golden.py`` takes when it reads a dataset. And what
it hands back carries verdicts, counts and column NAMES only. Never a cell, and never the answer
key's SQL: the payload being judged here is result data, and a score travels further than the run
that produced it.
