"""Read a statement into structured claims, and say where two of them disagree.

A golden item that fails on its numbers says the two statements returned different rows. It cannot
say *why*, and "why" is the whole value of the failure: a window off by a quarter, a required filter
left out and a genuinely different question all look identical from a row count. This module is the
sentence after that one. It reads each statement into seven claims about what the statement asks
for, compares them claim by claim, and hands the caller a structured diff.

**It is a describer with two gates, and the split is the design.** Five of the seven claims are
REPORTED — a difference in them is a fact for a person to read, not a verdict — and exactly two are
allowed to decide anything:

* a column the dataset requires filtered that the statement constrains NOWHERE, and
* a date window that resolves, on both sides, to a different interval.

Those two were selected because neither can false-positive. A column is either mentioned in one of
the statement's own predicates or it is not, and that scan errs toward "filtered": it reads WHERE,
every join's ON (outer joins included), HAVING, QUALIFY and an aggregate's own FILTER, so a
predicate written anywhere at all disarms the gate. A window gates only when BOTH statements resolve
to one; a spelling the resolver does not model reads `unknown` and gates nothing, because failing a
correct statement on this module's own incompleteness is the one outcome a gate must never have.

Three things this module deliberately does NOT do:

* **It does not score.** There is one deterministic scorer for the eval mode, and a second one
  living here would be a second answer to the same question. This emits claims; the scorer folds
  them in.
* **It does not parse SQL itself.** Every parse goes through `runtime._parse_reporting`, the one
  helper that reads a statement in the engine's own grammar and raises rather than silently
  truncating the tree, and every normalization reuses runtime's own helpers. A second parser would
  be a second reading of the same statement, and the two would drift.
* **It does not normalize an inclusive date upper bound to the next day.** That transform is only
  sound on a `DATE` column, and nothing this module is handed carries a column type. So
  `BETWEEN '2025-01-01' AND '2025-12-31'` resolves to an upper bound of `2025-12-31` INCLUSIVE and
  the half-open year to `2026-01-01` EXCLUSIVE, and the two are reported as the different intervals
  they are on a timestamp column.
