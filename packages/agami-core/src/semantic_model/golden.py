"""Reader for the golden datasets under ``<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/golden_datasets/``.

A golden dataset is a file of questions whose answer is already agreed: the author writes the
question, the SQL they accept as the answer key, and how strictly a run has to match it. The
runner that consumes these decides pass/fail, so this module's whole job is to hand it records
it can trust — and to say out loud which files and cases it had to drop getting there.

Two properties are load-bearing:

* **Fault isolation.** One malformed file, or one malformed case inside an otherwise good file,
  must not cost the run every other case. Each fault becomes a finding and the read continues,
  so a typo costs one case rather than the whole suite.
* **No path escapes.** Nothing returned carries a filesystem path. A downstream runner cannot
  forward a dataset location into a subprocess because it never receives one — the records are
  self-sufficient by construction rather than by the runner's good manners.
