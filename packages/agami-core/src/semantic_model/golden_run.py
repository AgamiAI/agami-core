"""Run a golden dataset: ask for a statement, run both sides, score every item.

A golden dataset is a file of questions whose answers are already agreed. `golden.py` reads it,
`comparator.py` scores one result set against another and `golden_claims.py` says where two
statements disagree. This module is the loop that puts the three together: for each case it asks
the product to answer the question, executes the answer key and the generated statement, scores
them, and folds the statement diff's two gates into the verdict.

Three properties decide whether the resulting numbers mean anything, and none of them is visible
in a score:

* **The generating context never holds the answer key.** A model that can see `expected.sql` is
  grading itself against a key it can read, and every assertion over the scores would still pass.
  So `SqlGenerator.generate` takes a question and nothing else — the isolation is the SHAPE of the
  seam rather than a rule a caller has to keep. `run_golden_dataset` reads `expected.sql` only
  after the generator has already answered.
* **The generating context never holds a result row.** Generation strictly precedes execution, so
  at the moment the generator is called there is no row in existence to leak.
* **The run is deterministic.** Every verdict is arithmetic over two result sets and two parsed
  statements. Nothing here asks a model to judge anything, and the pass mark is `comparator`'s
  alone — exactly `accuracy == 1.0`, with no second threshold applied on top of the match level
  the author already chose.

**Nothing in the loop raises.** `execute_guarded` is total, `compare_result_sets` never raises and
`compare_statements` never raises, so one bad case costs that case rather than the run. The one
exception is the injected generator, which is somebody else's code: a generator that RAISES is not
answering, so the run stops there and reports that it did not finish, rather than scoring the
remaining items against something that is not working.

The one shipped generator, `ClaudeCliGenerator`, spawns the operator's own client as a child
process. Three decisions about that child are load-bearing and are pinned by tests rather than by
this docstring: **every tool and every MCP server is switched off by an explicit flag** and the
child starts in an empty directory, so the schema inlined in its prompt is the only thing it can
read; its environment is an explicit **allowlist** rather than the inherited one (the parent's
environment carries the dataset's own root and the warehouse credentials); and its **stderr is
never surfaced** — a client can echo the prompt there, and a failed generation is reported as a
fixed, value-free sentence.

The flags are the load-bearing half of that first decision, and it is worth saying why here too:
in this client the ABSENCE of a tool flag means every built-in tool, not none of them. A child left
at its defaults could read files, glob and run commands, and `HOME` is on the allowlist — which is
the whole of the route to the artifacts pointer, the dataset and the answer key inside it.

# every run of this generator gets the same four decisions, or none of them.
#
# Do not delete a flag here as noise. In this client the ABSENCE of a flag is not deny-all, it is
# the permissive default, and each of these three overrides one:
#
# * `--tools ""` — omitting it gives the child EVERY built-in tool, Read and Glob and Bash among
#   them. `""` is the documented way to spell "none of them".
# * `--strict-mcp-config` — the default loads the operator's user-scope, project-scope, `.mcp.json`
#   and plugin MCP servers. With this flag the child uses only the servers `--mcp-config` names,
#   and no `--mcp-config` is passed, so that is the empty set.
# * `--setting-sources ""` — the default loads the user, project and local setting sources, which
#   is how a `CLAUDE.md`, a `.claude/settings.json` or a `.mcp.json` would reach the child.
#
# All three matter because `HOME` is on the environment allowlist below, and every path this run
# withholds the name of is computed from it: the artifacts pointer, the artifacts directory it
# names, the dataset inside that carrying `expected.sql` and its recorded rows, and the warehouse
# credentials file beside it. A child with no tool to read a file has no use for `HOME`, which is
# what makes withholding the NAME of the path sufficient. `-p` is print mode — read a prompt from
# stdin, write an answer, exit. What the model needs to write a statement — the tables and
# columns — is inlined in the prompt instead, by whoever built this generator.

# a list of things somebody has to remember to add to; an allowlist is one nobody can forget.
#
# `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is here because it is the one credential the child EXISTS to use — the
# operator's own key for their own client, in a process whose only job is to answer a question. It
# is not a datasource credential, and no datasource credential has a name that could reach this
# tuple.
#
# `HOME` is here because a client that cannot find its own configuration cannot start, and it is
# inert only because of the flags above: the artifacts pointer, the dataset and the credentials file
# are all under it, so this list withholds the NAME of a path the child has no tool to open. The two
# halves are one decision — never add a tool without revisiting this tuple.
#
# `USER` is here for the same reason as `HOME` and was missed for the same reason it is easy to miss:
# an operator with `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` set never needs it, and that is the machine this list was

    `schema` is the tables and columns the model may write against, already rendered by whoever
    built this generator — inlining it is what makes the no-tools invocation above sufficient. It
    may also be a CALLABLE taking the question, for a caller whose context depends on what is being
    asked: ranked prompt examples are chosen per question, and a caller that had to pick them before
    the loop would send every example to every item. Resolving it here rather than widening
    `SqlGenerator.generate` keeps that argument list — the isolation boundary — unchanged.

    `timeout_s` is `subprocess.run`'s own bound, so a client that hangs is killed rather than waited
    on. Execution has no timer of its own here: its bound is the deployment's, at the chokepoint.

    That bound is THIS generator's and not the runner's, and the difference matters to whoever
    injects another one. `SqlGenerator.generate` has no parameter that could carry a timeout — the
    argument list is the isolation, so widening it is a contract change — which means an injected
    generator that hangs hangs the run, with nothing above it to cut the call off.
