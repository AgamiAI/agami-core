"""Shared pydantic contracts for the 4 product tools.

These pin the **data shapes** the product tools exchange — `list_datasources`,
`get_datasource_schema`, `get_prompt_examples`, `execute_sql` — plus the `ActivitySink` log
records, so downstream consumers build against fixed shapes instead of inventing their own.

The trust `receipt` is deliberately NOT one of them. It rides every `execute_sql` body on all
three statuses, and it is typed by `guardrail.Receipt` — a frozen dataclass in the stdlib-only
module the plugin mirror vendors, which is the one place both the executor and the tool edge can
reach. A second pydantic spelling of it here would be a shape nothing validated against and a
second thing to keep in step.

Source of truth = the **existing** local tool I/O in `mcp_harness.py` (the JSON each tool emits).
The shapes are the local, **subject-area-primary** model shape.

Two stances make these contracts, not a rewrite:
  - `extra="allow"` — the local serving path is the source; a richer serving backend must still
    parse, and round-tripping must not silently drop fields. So unknown keys are kept.
  - Optional/permissive where the source is — these document the surface, they don't tighten it.
