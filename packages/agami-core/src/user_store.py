"""The `users` store + the password credential check — per-user identity for the hosted server.

This is the credential authenticator the OAuth authorize page calls: `authenticate` turns a
username/password into a `Principal` (the identity the token endpoint then mints a JWT for). It is
NOT the bearer-token `AuthProvider` (that validates the issued token — a later, separate adapter).
Flat access only: there is no role column (roles are paid).

Thin SQL over the portable `Store` (same shape as `model_store.py`), so it runs on SQLite (CI) and

    in the WHERE rather than trusted to the caller: a guard a route forgets to apply is a guard that
    is not there, and this UPDATE is one route away from a public page.

    - `oidc_provider IS NULL` — an SSO identity never grows a password. Without it, a reset would add
      a second way into an account whose deployment decided there is exactly one, and the person
      whose password it is would have no idea it existed.
    - `status = ?` (active) — a reset cannot resurrect a switched-off account. The account being off

    - `password_hash = ?` (`expected_hash`) — **this is what actually makes a reset link single-use.**

    `commit=False` leaves the transaction open so the caller can land the revocation of that

    the old one is a reset in name only, and the two must not be separately committable.

    This is what makes a reset link **single-use**, and it needs its own mechanism because the one
    that makes a *setup* link single-use does not apply: a setup token dies because claiming flips the
    account out of pending, and a reset leaves the account exactly as claimed as it was. So the token
    carries this marker, the claim page re-computes it, and setting a new password changes the stored
    hash — which retires every link minted against the old one, including the one just used.

    **A hash of the hash, never the hash itself.** A setup link's payload is base64url and readable by
    whoever holds it (`onboarding`'s module note says so), so putting `password_hash` in a token would
    hand an argon2 digest to anyone the link is forwarded to. Truncated because this is a change
    detector, not a credential: it needs to differ when the hash differs, and it is compared only
    against a value re-derived from the same row.

    Argon2 salts every hash, so re-setting the *same* password still produces a different digest and
    still retires the old link. `authenticate`'s opportunistic rehash changes the stored hash too, so
    a cost-parameter bump silently spends outstanding reset links on the owner's next sign-in — which
    is the safe direction and worth knowing before it looks like a bug.

    **Raises for an account with no password**, rather than fingerprinting the empty string. That
    fallback would have produced `sha256("")` — one publicly computable constant, identical for every
    passwordless row in every deployment — so the marker would have been a marker of nothing and the
    single-use binding would have been vacuous exactly where the account is most exposed. There is no
