"""
Read-only / dangerous-SQL guard — the single source of truth for "is this SQL
safe to run against the user's database?".

This gate runs at the shared executor chokepoint (`execute_sql.py::main`) and as a
fail-fast pre-check in the MCP tool layer (`tools.check_read_only`), so the stdio
server, the HTTP/OAuth server, the agami-query skill, and cron are all protected
identically — not just whichever path happened to read a prose rule.

It is defense in depth at the application layer; the underlying connection is *also*
expected to run under a read-only role. The statement-shape checks are dialect-neutral;
the dangerous-function deny-list is not, so it names the side-effecting primitives of
every engine the executor dispatches to — Postgres / Redshift, MySQL, Snowflake,
Databricks, SQL Server, BigQuery, Oracle, SQLite / DuckDB — and not Postgres alone.

`check_read_only(sql)` returns `None` when the SQL is a single safe read-only
statement, else a `guardrail.Refusal` carrying `rule=read_only`, the rejection text as
`detail`, and the fix for that specific rejection as `remediation`. Callers relay the
whole object rather than re-deriving a shape of their own.

    A stack of independent regex subs (one per construct) CANNOT do this: whichever
    regex runs first is blind to the others, so a `'` inside a `$$...$$` body, or a
    `$$` inside a `-- ...` comment, desyncs it and can smuggle an injected
    `; DROP ...` past the multi-statement check. The scan below never desyncs
    because at each position it commits to whatever opens there and skips to that
    construct's own close.

    Under-matching (a construct running unterminated to EOF) fails *safe*, but by two
    different routes and it is worth being exact, because the `#` branch below cites this
    paragraph as its reason for refusing rather than blanking. An unterminated `"` or `$`
    emits what it swallowed, so a stray `;` stays visible and trips the guard. An
    unterminated `'` or `/*` instead swallows to EOF and the tail becomes invisible here —
    safe not because the guard still sees it, but because the ENGINE reads that tail the
    same way (an unterminated literal or block comment is a syntax error on every engine we
    speak, so nothing executes). That second route is the one a `#` would NOT have: there,
    the guard and the engine genuinely disagree about where the statement ends.

    Only this analysis copy is transformed; the ORIGINAL sql is what executes.
    Neutralized spans collapse to a single space (never empty — welding tokens like
    `SELECT/**/INTO` -> `SELECTINTO` would defeat the `\\b` word boundaries below).

    Escapes: `''` inside a single-quoted literal and `""` inside a double-quoted
    identifier are treated as doubled-delimiter escapes (standard SQL). Backslash is
    deliberately NOT an escape here — engines disagree (MySQL yes, standard PG no),
    and not honoring it can only stop a literal *early* (fail safe), never late.

# FUNCTIONS ONLY. No schema names, no relation names, no relation-name prefixes, no system
# variables. Catalog RELATIONS are the model's to refuse, not this gate's: `check_table_scope`
# already rejects `pg_class` and `information_schema.tables` as tables the model does not declare,
# which is the same refusal reached by the gate that owns it. The relation half was therefore
# redundant where the model gate runs — and where it does not run, it was actively harmful: matching
# bare schema names on every engine refused a datasource whose `sys` schema holds ordinary user
# tables. A schema the model declares is a schema the caller may query.
#
# The residual is stated rather than hidden: on the vendored plugin layout `semantic_model.runtime`
# is absent by construction (it needs sqlglot and pydantic; the mirror is stdlib-only), so catalog
# relations have no gate there at all. Recon denial protects an operator from a caller who is not
# them, and on that layout the user owns the machine, the credentials and the role.
#
# Niladic keywords and register-type casts are in scope because they are the same primitive in a
# spelling the function matcher never sees: `current_user` is `current_user()` without the parens,
# and `'x'::regclass` is `to_regclass('x')` without them either — the cast errors when the object is
# absent, which is an object-existence oracle that rides inside a fully-scoped query.
