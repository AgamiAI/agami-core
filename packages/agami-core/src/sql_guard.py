"""
Read-only / dangerous-SQL guard — the single source of truth for "is this SQL
safe to run against the user's database?".

This gate runs at the shared executor chokepoint (`execute_sql.py::main`) and as a
fail-fast pre-check in the MCP tool layer (`tools.check_read_only`), so the stdio
server, the HTTP/OAuth server, the agami-query skill, and cron are all protected
identically — not just whichever path happened to read a prose rule.

It is defense in depth at the application layer; the underlying connection is *also*
expected to run under a read-only role. Postgres / Redshift are the primary concern
(the dangerous functions below are Postgres server-side primitives), but the checks
are neutral enough to be safe across the other supported engines.

`check_read_only(sql)` returns `None` when the SQL is a single safe read-only
statement, else a safety `Verdict` the shared executor maps to a refusal
(`kind="permission"`). The rejection ladder itself lives in `_read_only_reason`.

    A stack of independent regex subs (one per construct) CANNOT do this: whichever

    `$$` inside a `-- ...` comment, desyncs it and can smuggle an injected

    because at each position it commits to whatever opens there and skips to that

    Only this analysis copy is transformed; the ORIGINAL sql is what executes.
    Neutralized spans collapse to a single space (never empty — welding tokens like
