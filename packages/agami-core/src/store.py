"""Backend-portable store — the thin DB layer the hosted server serves from.

A shared/multi-instance server can't keep state in local files, so the model + prompt examples are
served from a database and query logs are written to it. The backend is **Postgres in
production** (cloud-neutral, networked, multi-instance-safe), but the schema + queries are kept
**portable** so the same code runs on **SQLite** — which is what the test suite uses (no DB service
needed in CI) and is fine for a small single-instance self-host.

This module is the only place that knows a backend dialect. Everything above it (the model loader,
the activity sink, example serving) writes one set of SQL with `?` placeholders and uses dict rows,
and `Store` adapts to whichever backend `AGAMI_DB_URL` selects:

    sqlite://                      → in-memory (tests)
    sqlite:///abs/path/agami.db    → a file (self-host)
    postgresql://user:pw@host/db   → Postgres (production; needs the [server] extra)

Migrations are ordered `migrations/core/NNN_*.sql` applied idempotently via a `schema_migrations`
tracking table — re-running only applies new files.
