"""Serve the semantic model from the DB — the read path + the deploy-time writer.

The model-loader seam is just "produce a `Datasource`": the file adapter is
`semantic_model.loader.load_datasource(root)`; this is the DB adapter, which rebuilds the
**identical** `Datasource` from rows so every downstream tool (get_datasource_schema incl.
sizing, the receipt) is untouched. YAML stays the source of truth — `write_datasource` seeds the
rows from a YAML-loaded `Datasource` at deploy time (the `deploy_semantic_model.py` path).

Each object is stored as its key/structural columns + a `doc` (the object's `model_dump`), so the
rebuild is lossless without enumerating every pydantic field. The parent docs exclude their child
collections (those are their own rows); load re-attaches them.

    deployment serves NO model at all. So the only acceptable property here is that a collision

    That was the previous approach twice over — first the table pair alone, which collides for a
    self-join written two ways (`manager_id` and `mentor_id` on one employee table), then the pair
    plus columns, which still collides for two `on:`-expression joins (both columns are None there)

    and the next shape found the gap. A position in a list cannot repeat.

    The rest is for the human reading the table, and carries no uniqueness burden: schema-qualified
    endpoints, with the columns when the simple form is used. The `on:` expression is deliberately
