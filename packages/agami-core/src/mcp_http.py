"""agami serve --http — the HTTP MCP transport (streamable-HTTP).

Advertises the **same** shared `tools.TOOLS` registry as the stdio entrypoint, but over a network
endpoint a remote client (claude.ai) can reach — plus the OAuth-discovery surface and a bearer
auth shim. This is the network product: unlike the stdio harness it binds a port, so it carries
auth — an unauthenticated request gets a `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, which triggers the
client's OAuth flow against the authorize/token endpoints (see `oauth_server`). The issued JWT then
gates `/mcp`; with no signing secret configured the OSS bearer-presence default applies instead.

Requires the **[server]** extra (the MCP SDK + ASGI stack). `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must be set
explicitly — it backs the discovery documents + the `WWW-Authenticate` resource URL and cannot be
reliably auto-detected behind a proxy/LB.
