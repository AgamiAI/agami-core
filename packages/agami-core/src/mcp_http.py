"""agami serve --http — the HTTP MCP transport (streamable-HTTP).

Advertises the **same** shared `tools.TOOLS` registry as the stdio entrypoint, but over a network
endpoint a remote client (claude.ai) can reach — plus the OAuth-discovery surface and a bearer
auth shim. This is the network product: unlike the stdio harness it binds a port, so it carries
auth — an unauthenticated request gets a `401` + `WWW-Authenticate` challenge, which triggers the
client's OAuth flow against the authorize/token endpoints (see `oauth_server`). The issued JWT then
gates `/mcp`; with no signing secret configured the OSS bearer-presence default applies instead.

Requires the **[server]** extra (the MCP SDK + ASGI stack). `PUBLIC_BASE_URL` must be set
explicitly — it backs the discovery documents + the `WWW-Authenticate` resource URL and cannot be
reliably auto-detected behind a proxy/LB.

    model resolving "my"/"me" in the next turn has somewhere to read who is asking (ACE-118) — the
    audit log was the only consumer of `_actor_ctx` before this.

    Best-effort and additive ONLY: some existing test tools (and any third-party consumer's tool)
    return a bare string, not JSON, and this must never corrupt that. A body whose top level is not
    a JSON object — a bare string, or a JSON array — always returns `result_text` unchanged; an
    array has no field to add without changing the shape its consumer reads. With no actor, a body that also carries
    no `caller_identity` key returns unchanged too — but one that DOES carry that key is still
    reserialized with it stripped; see the overwrite-guarantee paragraph below.

    Handles a JSON object followed by trailing non-JSON text — `tool_get_datasource_schema` builds
    its response this way, a JSON payload with a "## Domain context" / "## USER_MEMORY.md" markdown
    suffix appended after it — by parsing only the leading JSON object and re-appending whatever
    followed it, untouched.

    **`tool_get_prompt_examples`'s local file-serving branch (no DB configured) is NOT handled, and
    this is not merely deferred scope — it is a mode where the gap cannot matter.** That branch
    returns a whole area's curated library as one YAML/Markdown document with no leading JSON
    object at all, so there is no prefix here to stamp. But "no `AGAMI_DB_URL`" is exactly the
    condition for the local single-player transport (`mcp_harness.py`), which has no authentication
    at all, by design — its own docs state the trust boundary is the OS user account, because there
    is nothing to authenticate to. `_actor_ctx` is only ever set inside this module's own
    `handle_mcp`, which that transport never reaches. So the one branch this can't stamp is also
    the one branch where `actor` is always `None` regardless — there is no real identity being
    withheld from the model here, on either surface a self-hosted or hosted deployment actually
    uses (both require a database, which is exactly what routes `get_prompt_examples` away from
    this branch and onto the one that already carries identity correctly). Restructuring this
    branch's response shape to carry a field that would always be empty is not a fix (ACE-118
    review).

    `caller_identity` is a reserved, server-injected field: it is ALWAYS overwritten with the true
    authenticated value, even when the tool's own JSON body already carries that key — deferring to
    an existing value would let any tool whose own domain data happens to use this field name spoof
    the asker to the model, which is instructed to trust it unconditionally (ACE-118 review).

    **The overwrite guarantee holds even with no actor.** An unresolved principal means there is
    nothing to SET the field to, but a tool-supplied `caller_identity` still has to be REMOVED —
    returning the body unchanged would let that same spoofed key through precisely when there is no
    real identity to contradict it, which is the worst case for it to survive (Copilot review).
