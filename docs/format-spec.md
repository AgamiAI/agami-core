# Format specs

agami's state splits across two directories. See `[plugins/agami/shared/file-layout.md](../plugins/agami/shared/file-layout.md)` for the full design rationale; this page is the per-file format reference.

## `<artifacts_dir>/local/` — secrets + per-user state — **NEVER commit**

`USER_MEMORY.md` is **distinct** from Claude Code's auto-memory at `~/.claude/projects/<workspace>/memory/MEMORY.md`. The auto-memory is host-managed and project-scoped; `USER_MEMORY.md` is agami-managed, lives in the artifacts dir, and persists across Claude Code hosts (CLI / VS Code extension / Cursor extension) the same way the rest of `<artifacts_dir>/` does.

`USER_MEMORY.md` covers **user preferences that apply across every database** (default time windows, display preferences, exclude rules). The per-database `**ORGANIZATION.md`** at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/ORGANIZATION.md` covers **domain knowledge for that specific database** (terminology, key metrics, what the data represents). See `[plugins/agami/shared/organization-context-format.md](../plugins/agami/shared/organization-context-format.md)`.

`<profile>` matches the section name in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials` (default: `default`). One *directory* per profile under `<artifacts_dir>/`. The `agami-connect` skill auto-migrates v1.0 (single-file) and v1.1 (under `<artifacts_dir>/local/`) installs on first run after upgrade.

## Why the split

Three concrete wins (full design in `[shared/file-layout.md](../plugins/agami/shared/file-layout.md)`):

1. **Zero credential-leak risk on commit.** `<artifacts_dir>/local/` is gitignored by default; `<artifacts_dir>/` is the only place anything goes when teams share.
2. **Team workflows just work.** `cd ~/code/myteam/data && git add agami/` commits everyone's tuned semantic model, examples, ORGANIZATION.md, and USER_MEMORY.md preferences.
3. **Power users override per-environment.** Set `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR=/path/to/staging-models` for an experimental session.

## 1. Credentials INI

See `[plugins/agami/shared/credentials-format.md](../plugins/agami/shared/credentials-format.md)`. `chmod 600` is enforced by `agami-connect` Phase 0a.

```ini
[default]
type     = postgres
host     = localhost
port     = 5432
database = mydb
user     = myuser
password = mypassword
```

---

## 2. Semantic model

The model is a **provider-portable, standard-concepts hierarchy** that any LLM can traverse to build reliable SQL against any backend:

```
Organization (org.yaml)
├─ Storage Connections[]   (physical: host/creds/dialect — datasources/<conn>/storage.yaml)
└─ Subject Areas[]         (logical — the primary unit the LLM consumes; cap ~20-30 tables)
   ├─ tables[]             (TableRefs into storage connections; expose_column_groups scopes wide tables)
   ├─ tables_defined[]     (canonical Table: columns, grain, default_filters, caveats, column_groups)
   ├─ entities[]           (vocabulary → maps_to columns; value_pattern for opaque IDs)
   ├─ metrics[]            (calculation prose + per-dialect bindings)
   └─ relationships[]      (FK graph; REQUIRED join cardinality + trust block)
└─ cross_subject_area_relationships[]   (org-level edges spanning areas)
```

The Pydantic models in [`plugins/agami/scripts/semantic_model/models.py`](../plugins/agami/scripts/semantic_model/models.py) **are** the spec (they `forbid` unknown keys). Provider-portable declarative fields — `default_filters`, `value_transform`, `caveats`, `value_pattern`, `sensitive`, `default_time_window`, join `cardinality` — are applied generically by the MCP/runtime, so behavior is identical across LLMs.

Every write is gated by the validator at [`plugins/agami/scripts/semantic_model/validator.py`](../plugins/agami/scripts/semantic_model/validator.py) (driven via `python3 -m semantic_model.cli validate <root>`). **No model that fails validation is ever persisted.**

### Worked example — a minimal model on disk

```yaml
# org.yaml
organization: shop
version: 1
description: E-commerce shop.
storage_connections:
  - { name: shop_postgres, ref: datasources/shop_postgres/storage.yaml }
subject_areas: [subject_areas/sales]
cross_subject_area_relationships: []
```
```yaml
# datasources/shop_postgres/storage.yaml
name: shop_postgres
storage_type: PostgreSQL
storage_config: { profile: shop, credentials_ref: "<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials" }
```
```yaml
# subject_areas/sales/subject_area.yaml
name: sales
description: Sales analytics across orders and customers.
tables:
  - { storage_connection: shop_postgres, schema: public, table: orders }
  - { storage_connection: shop_postgres, schema: public, table: customers }
```
```yaml
# subject_areas/sales/tables/orders.yaml
name: orders
schema: public
storage_connection: shop_postgres
grain: [id]
description: One row per order.
default_filters: ["{alias}.deleted_at IS NULL"]
columns:
  - { name: id, type: integer, primary_key: true }
  - { name: customer_id, type: integer, foreign_key: { table: customers, column: id } }
  - { name: status, type: string, choice_field: { pending: Pending, shipped: Shipped } }
  - { name: amount, type: decimal, caveats: ["Amount in USD; excludes refunds."] }
```
```yaml
# subject_areas/sales/relationships.yaml
relationships:
  - from_table: orders
    from_column: customer_id
    to_table: customers
    to_column: id
    relationship: many_to_one        # REQUIRED — fan-trap detector consumes this
    confidence: confirmed
    review_state: approved
    signed_off_by: agami_introspect
    signed_off_role: system
    signed_off_at: "2026-06-09T00:00:00Z"
```
```yaml
# subject_areas/sales/metrics/total_revenue.yaml
name: total_revenue
calculation: Total revenue across all orders (USD, excludes refunds).
bindings: { PostgreSQL: "SUM(orders.amount)" }
source_tables: [orders]
other_names: [revenue, gross sales]
confidence: proposed
review_state: unreviewed             # Rule 1: needs sign-off before the runtime uses it
```

### Validation rules

The validator combines Pydantic structural validation (required fields, enums, relationship completeness — exactly one of `from_column`+`to_column` OR `on:`, one primary per entity) with cross-cutting invariants:

1. **Relationship cardinality required** on every join; **trust-block parity** (`signed_off_*` required when `review_state: approved`).
2. **FK type-compatibility** — a simple-FK join with mismatched column types caps `confidence` at `proposed` and suggests a `CAST` in `on:` (BigQuery `INT64 = STRING` class of bug).
3. **Subject-area sizing** — warn at 25 tables, error at 30.
4. **Deep-table column_groups** — tables ≥ 30 columns must declare `column_groups`; no column may be orphaned; `expose_column_groups` must reference declared groups; every `TableRef.table` resolves to a `tables_defined` entry (org-wide, for multi-membership).
5. **default_filters** reference only existing columns; **value_transform** / **on:** parse with sqlglot; **caveats** non-empty; **choice_field** keys match the column type.
6. **Cross-area entity name-collision** → warning + a suggested cross-cutting unification.

The verdict is **binding**: `cli validate` exits 0 → ok, 1 → errors. `cli curate` and the introspection engine refuse / revert on a non-zero verdict.

## 3. Examples library YAML

Few-shot NL→SQL pairs loaded by `query-database` (most-recent 50). Appended to by the `agami-save-correction` skill.

```yaml
# <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml

examples:
  - question: How many orders are there?
    sql: SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders
    source: seed
    created_at: 2026-05-06T12:00:00Z

  - question: Top 5 customers by spend
    sql: |-
      SELECT c.name, SUM(o.amount) AS spend
      FROM customers c
      JOIN orders o ON o.customer_id = c.id
      GROUP BY c.id, c.name
      ORDER BY spend DESC
      LIMIT 5
    source: correction
    created_at: 2026-05-07T18:30:00Z
    confirmed: true
    confirmed_at: 2026-05-07T18:30:00Z
```


| Field          | Type    | Required | Description                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `question`     | string  | yes      | NL question that triggers this example                                                            |
| `sql`          | string  | yes      | Reference SQL                                                                                     |
| `source`       | enum    | yes      | `seed` (auto-generated by `connect`) or `correction` (saved by the `agami-save-correction` skill) |
| `created_at`   | ISO8601 | yes      | When the example was added                                                                        |
| `confirmed`    | bool    | no       | `true` if the user explicitly confirmed it                                                        |
| `confirmed_at` | ISO8601 | no       | When confirmed                                                                                    |


**Why separate?** The semantic model carries structure + metrics, not NL→SQL examples. The examples library is its own scope-tagged file per subject area.

## 4. User memory (free-form Markdown)

`<artifacts_dir>/USER_MEMORY.md` (committable top-level, **not** under `local/` — it's cross-DB preferences worth sharing, not a secret) holds free-form preferences and policies that don't belong in the semantic model — default filters, domain vocabulary, display preferences, hard avoids. Every agami skill loads this file on each invocation and applies what's in it to SQL generation, formatting, and follow-up suggestions.

Seeded by `agami-connect` Phase 0a on first run with section hints (HTML comments). User edits by hand, OR the `agami-save-correction` skill appends a bullet when it classifies a correction as `user_preference` ("from now on, always exclude test users where email matches @example.com").

Full spec: `[plugins/agami/shared/user-memory-format.md](../plugins/agami/shared/user-memory-format.md)`.

## 5. Internal state files

### `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config`

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "active_profile": "main",
  "artifacts_dir": "/Users/me/agami-artifacts",
  "reviewer_email": "you@example.com",
  "reviewer_role": "data_lead",
  "tier": "cli",
  "host": "claude-code-cli",
  "tool_paths": {
    "psql": "/opt/homebrew/bin/psql",
    "sqlite3": "/usr/bin/sqlite3"
  }
}
```

Written by `agami-connect` Phase 0a on first run; updated by `agami-model` (its Review tab) the first time the curator approves a Rule 1 item (the `reviewer_email` + `reviewer_role` get persisted so future sessions don't re-ask).

> **Note on `artifacts_dir`:** this field is recorded for reference (and read as a fallback signal that onboarding has already chosen a folder), but it is **not** the authoritative locator — `.config` lives *inside* `<artifacts_dir>/local/`, so it can't bootstrap its own location. The source of truth for finding `<artifacts_dir>` is, in order: `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` → the `~/.config/agami/path` pointer → the default `~/agami-artifacts`.

### `<artifacts_dir>/local/.optins`

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "github_star_asked": true,
  "github_star_response": "yes_opened",
  "ts": "2026-05-07T18:30:00Z"
}
```

`github_star_response` is one of `yes_opened` (user clicked through to GitHub), `maybe_later`, or `already_starred`. Existence of the file is the never-re-prompt gate — we ask exactly once, after the user's first successful query.

### `<artifacts_dir>/local/query_log.jsonl`

```jsonl
{"ts":"2026-05-07T15:14:00Z","question":"how many orders shipped in May","sql":"SELECT ...","row_count":4,"execution_ms":250,"tier":"cli","risk":"LOW","error_kind":null,"feedback":"good","chart_path":"/Users/me/.agami/charts/20260507-141500.html"}
```

| `tier`           | enum             | Connection method that ran the query: `cli` (native CLI), `duckdb`, `python` (Python driver). Field name is `tier` for backward-compatibility with v1.0 logs.                   |
| `risk`           | enum             | `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH` (large-table risk classifier)                                                                                                                         |

| `chart_path`     | string or null   | Absolute path of the HTML report from Phase 4e, or null if the query returned a 1×1 scalar that didn't get a report. Read by `query-database`'s reopen-intent flow (Phase 2a.1) |
| `tables_used`    | array of strings | Qualified `<schema>.<table>` names the SQL FROMs/JOINs. For two-pass retrieval (Phase 2b large mode), this is what Pass 1 picked; for small mode, parsed from the SQL.          |
| `retrieval_mode` | enum             | `small` or `large` — which Phase 2b branch ran. Useful for tuning the 50-table threshold.                                                                                       |
