## Get started in 2 minutes

In the **Claude Code CLI**:

```bash
/plugin marketplace add AgamiAI/agami-core
/plugin install agami-core@agami
/agami-connect sample          # zero setup: no database, no credentials
who are the top 5 customers by total spend?
```

> **In VS Code or Cursor**, the two `/plugin …` commands above don't work from the chat input —
> type `/plugin` to open the **Manage Plugins** dialog and add the marketplace + install the plugin
> there instead (see [Install](#install)). The `/agami-connect` line and everything after it work the
> same everywhere.

That last line returns a **governed answer with a receipt** (the exact SQL, the joins used, the model version) — and the governance runs *before* the query, so the kind of silent join mistake an ungoverned agent would hand back as a confident wrong number never reaches you. Two ways to go from here:

- 🧪 **No database?** The commands above answer from a built-in sample — nothing leaves your machine.
- 🗄️ **Have a database?** Run `/agami-connect` to introspect it into a governed semantic model, then just ask questions.

Each path is walked through in full below ([Quickstart](#quickstart-under-5-minutes) · [Install](#install)).

Point an AI agent at a database and it answers by **guessing** — at the join, at what *"revenue"* means, at which rows it's allowed to read. **agami-core** is the governed layer between the agent and your data: it turns your schema into a semantic model where every join is FK-derived or human-approved, every metric is **signed off** by name and role, and every answer ships a **receipt** — the exact SQL, the model version it pinned, and who vouched for each definition. The rules live in the model, **not the prompt**. And it all runs on your machine — credentials, schema, and results never leave it.

## What you get

- ✅ **Governed answers, not guesses** — every join is FK-derived or human-approved; every metric is signed off (name + role) before the runtime trusts it.
- 🧾 **A receipt on every answer** — the literal SQL, the tables touched, the relationships used, and the model version it pinned. Reproducible, auditable.
- 🔒 **Local and private** — runs inside Claude Code via Bash/Read/Write. Credentials, schema, and results never touch a server we operate.
- 🧩 **A portable semantic model** — plain, git-native YAML you own (subject areas, tables, entities, metrics, relationships). No lock-in.
- 🗄️ **Works with your database** — Postgres · Supabase · Redshift · MySQL · Snowflake · BigQuery · SQL Server · Oracle · Databricks · Trino · DuckDB · SQLite.
- 🛠️ **Zero infra to start** — no backend, no proxy. If you have a DB CLI you have everything; an optional local MCP server lets Claude Desktop use the same model.
- 👥 **Shareable with your team** *(early access — in testing)* — self-host [one governed server](#self-hosted-team-server--early-access-in-testing) that your whole team and business users query from their own Claude over a URL, still zero-egress. The team layer is newer than the local path; we're validating it with early users.

## Quickstart (under 5 minutes)

### Fastest path — the built-in sample (no database, no credentials)

agami ships with **Acme Store**, a small local SQLite dataset (commerce +
subscriptions) and a ready-made, signed-off semantic model. You get a governed
answer — with a full receipt — in under a minute, and nothing leaves your machine.

```bash
# 1. Install the plugin (see Install below for the per-host steps).

# 2. Try the sample — no connection needed:
/agami-connect sample      # or just say "I don't have a database" / "try the sample"

# 3. Ask a question — see governance ENFORCED:
who are the top 5 customers by total spend?

# 4. Now watch the model get BUILT — see governance MADE:
/agami-connect reintrospect
```

**Step 3 is where the governance fires.** The sample question is deliberately one
an ungoverned agent gets *confidently wrong* — a multi-table join where a naive
agent silently returns a bad number. agami's pre-flight catches it and returns the
correct answer *with a join receipt* — the trust layer, enforced on your very first
query.

**Step 4 is the real point.** Natural-language querying is everywhere; what's rare
is *where the trust comes from*. `reintrospect` re-derives the sample's model from
the live schema — introspect → infer + confidence-score every join → gate metric
sign-off → re-validate examples — so you watch the governed model take shape rather
than just consuming it. To see it built **from a blank slate** (full LLM
enrichment, descriptions and all), run `/agami-connect sample` and pick **"build
the model from scratch so I can see it work"** the first time. Either way it takes
a few minutes — it's the demo of *how* the receipts you saw in step 3 are earned.
Full flow: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).

### Your own database

Connecting your database is a short back-and-forth with agami — you fill in one
template, and it handles the rest:

1. **Start setup.** Run `/agami-connect` (or just say *"connect to my database"*).
   agami asks which database you use, has you name the connection, and writes a
   credentials template for you to fill in.
2. **Fill in the template.** Open the file agami points you to, add your connection
   details, and save it — leave the filename as-is. agami only ever runs **read-only**
   queries, so a read-only database user is all it needs; ask agami for *"the read-only
   grant"* and it gives you the exact SQL to create one.
3. **Say *"introspect my database"*** (or just *"continue"*). agami takes it from there:
   it locks the file down for you (no manual `chmod`), reads your schema, builds the
   semantic model, and seeds a few validated example queries. You don't move or rename
   anything.
4. **Ask a question** — *"how many orders did we ship last month?"*

That's the whole setup. Along the way agami scores its confidence in every join and
entity, auto-approves the clear ones (real foreign keys, well-named columns), and asks
you to sign off the judgment calls. Full walkthrough: [docs/usage.md](docs/usage.md).
Connection details for each database: [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md).

## Databases supported

agami runs your SQL **locally**, with whatever's already on your machine — a native database CLI, the
DuckDB universal binary, or a Python driver — picking the best option available. No agami-operated
server ever sees your data.

| Database | How agami runs the SQL |
|---|---|
| **PostgreSQL** · **Supabase** | `psql` CLI · DuckDB · `psycopg2` |
| **Redshift** | `psql` · `psycopg2` (speaks the Postgres wire protocol) |
| **MySQL** / **MariaDB** | `mysql` CLI · DuckDB · `pymysql` |
| **Snowflake** | `snowsql` CLI · `snowflake-connector-python` |
| **BigQuery** | `bq` CLI · `google-cloud-bigquery` |
| **SQL Server** / Azure SQL | `pymssql` |
| **Oracle** | `python-oracledb` (thin mode — no client libs) |
| **Databricks** | `databricks-sql-connector` |
| **Trino** / Presto | `trino` |
| **DuckDB** | `duckdb` binary or module |
| **SQLite** | `sqlite3` (Python stdlib — nothing to install) |

If you have a native CLI on your `PATH`, that's used first (nothing to `pip install`); otherwise agami
falls back to the Python driver for that database. Per-database connection fields and the read-only-grant
SQL for every dialect are in [docs/credentials.md](docs/credentials.md).

## Install

> **Platform note.** Validated on **macOS and Linux**. On **Windows** the skills
> need **[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win)** (Claude Code uses
> Git Bash for its Bash tool); Windows is not yet validated end-to-end. The
> optional local MCP server is pure-stdlib Python and is cross-platform.

The same plugin works across Claude Code CLI, VS Code, and Cursor.

**Claude Code CLI** — in the Claude Code prompt:
```
/plugin marketplace add AgamiAI/agami-core
/plugin install agami-core@agami
```
Verify with `/plugin list` → you should see `agami-core@agami` installed.

**VS Code / Cursor** — the slash-command install form above is **CLI-only**; in the extension you
install through the UI. Install the **Claude Code** extension, type `/plugin` in the chat to open the
**Manage Plugins** dialog, paste `AgamiAI/agami-core` into the marketplace input and click **Add**, then
switch to the **Plugins** tab and click **Install** on `agami-core`.

Per-host walkthroughs: [docs/install/](docs/install/).

## The trust layer

Most AI data agents quietly pick a join, quietly pick a definition of "revenue",
and quietly return a number. agami makes every one of those decisions auditable:

- **Confidence + review state on every entry.** Each join, metric, and entity
  carries a flat trust block (`confidence`, `review_state`, and a sign-off
  identity once approved) — no vendor blobs, no scores to tune. DB-declared FKs
  and structural column names auto-approve; everything inferred stays
  `unreviewed` and surfaces in the Review tab.
- **Metrics must be signed off (Rule 1).** A metric needs an approver email, a
  role, and a non-empty `calculation` before the runtime treats it as truth —
  one bad metric skews every report that uses it. Joins & entities are lazy
  (Rule 2): usable while unreviewed, flagged on the receipt until confirmed.
- **Every answer ships a receipt** — the literal SQL, tables + row counts,
  relationships used (with confidence/state), metric definitions with author +
  date, data freshness, and the model snapshot hash. A warning banner appears if
  any unreviewed entry was used. Nothing is silently trusted.
- **Snapshot-pinned + git-native.** The model is YAML under
  `~/agami-artifacts/<profile>/`, `git init`'d on first introspect. Every answer
  records the model snapshot hash, so old answers reproduce exactly and schema
  drift flips affected entries to `stale` instead of silently changing the number.

Full mechanics — the trust block, Rule 1/Rule 2, the review queue, the receipt,
examples validation: **[docs/trust-layer.md](docs/trust-layer.md)**.

## Skills (slash commands)

Natural-language phrasing routes to each skill automatically — "open the review
dashboard" / "save this as a correction" / "introspect my schema" all work without
typing the slash command.

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `/agami-connect` | One-stop setup + introspect: detect/collect credentials, introspect the live DB into the semantic model (tables, columns, PK grain, FK relationships, sensitive-column flags), layer LLM enrichment, generate EXPLAIN-validated seed examples. Validator-gated; `git init` + snapshots. Also `/agami-connect sample` for the no-DB sample. |
| `/agami-query` | Answers a natural-language question: picks examples + relationships, generates and runs SQL, formats the result + chart, and surfaces a provenance receipt. Flags any unreviewed entry it relied on. (Usually you don't type this — plain language routes here.) |
| `/agami-model` | One dashboard to **browse, curate, and sign off** the model: every table/field/metric/entity/join, per-table/column Exclude/Include, edits, new metrics. The **Review** tab is the trust-layer sign-off queue. Open it on the queue with `/agami-model review`. |
| `/agami-save-correction` | Records a correction and routes it to the right home (SQL example, column metadata, display preference, business concept, or a new metric), showing its classification before writing. Attribution surfaces on future answers it influences. |
| `/agami-reconcile` | Point it at an existing dashboard — a **screenshot** (Metabase / Power BI / Tableau / Looker) or a CSV of known numbers; it generates each question, runs it through agami, and shows a side-by-side diff with tolerances. Validate the model against numbers you already trust. |
| `/agami-serve` | Use agami from the **Claude Desktop** app: wires up the optional local MCP server (same tools as the hosted connector, backed by your local model + execution — stdio, read-only, no network). See [docs/mcp-server.md](docs/mcp-server.md). |
| `/agami-deploy` *(early access — in testing)* | **Deploy a shared team server.** Writes a ready-to-run Docker bundle (the published image + HTTPS + OAuth + an admin console) so a team can stand up one governed server their Claude connects to. Business users query it over a URL — no local setup. Newer than the local path — we're validating it with early users ([details + how to give feedback](deploy/README.md)). |

## Privacy

agami runs entirely locally — credentials (`chmod 600`), the semantic model, charts,
exports, and dashboards all live under `~/agami-artifacts/`, and the skill never
reads files outside those paths (except your DB tool's auth config, set up on first
connect with your permission). Details: [docs/privacy.md](docs/privacy.md).

## Fair-code vs hosted

agami is **fair-code** (source-available). Everything here — introspection, the portable
semantic model, NL→SQL + local execution, the trust layer, corrections, and self-hosting for
your own organization — is **free** (serving people outside your organization needs a commercial
license). The hosted cloud adds the org-scale layer on top: advanced governance and access
controls (**RBAC**, audit, enterprise **SSO** with SAML/SCIM), a shared multi-tenant model
registry, and continuous evals. What's free vs paid, in full:
[docs/open-vs-hosted.md](docs/open-vs-hosted.md).

## Self-hosted team server — Early access (in testing)

> 🧪 **Early access.** This team layer is **usable today**, but it's newer than the local single-player
> path and we're still ironing it out with early users — expect the occasional rough edge. Please send
> feedback or report anything broken via a [**GitHub issue**](https://github.com/AgamiAI/agami-core/issues).
> The local experience above is the stable, generally-available path.

The local setup is single-player. To put your **whole team — and non-technical business users — on
one governed model**, deploy agami's **HTTP MCP server** to your own host. Everyone then connects
their own Claude (claude.ai as a custom connector, or the desktop app) to **one HTTPS URL** and asks
questions in plain language. They install nothing, touch no credentials, and only ever see the model
you've governed. An admin console (`/admin`) controls who's allowed in; the warehouse stays behind a
read-only user, and **no data leaves your environment**.

The paved path is one command in Claude:

```bash
/agami-deploy      # writes a ready-to-run Docker bundle: published image + HTTPS (Caddy) + OAuth + admin
```

It gathers your hostname and admin identity, writes `docker-compose.yml` + a filled `agami.env`
(referencing the published `ghcr.io/agamiai/agami-core` image — no clone, no build), and either runs
`docker compose up` locally or prints the exact VM steps and the shareable `/mcp` URL.

**The full step-by-step — VM, DNS/TLS, and every variant (Cloudflare Tunnel, managed Postgres,
Cloud Run) — is in [deploy/README.md](deploy/README.md).** (Prefer to wire it up by hand instead of
using the bundle? The [manual install + environment-variable reference](docs/self-hosting.md) covers
that.) Admins sign in with a password; teammates get per-user access to `/mcp`.

It's cloud-neutral (a VM + Postgres, or a serverless platform + managed Postgres), configured entirely
by environment variables, and **LLM-free + zero-egress by default**. Self-hosting this for people
**inside your organization is free**; exposing data to people outside it is the paid line
([fair-code vs hosted](docs/open-vs-hosted.md)).
