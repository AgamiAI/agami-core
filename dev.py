"""Cross-platform dev task runner for agami-core.

Run a task with:  uv run dev.py <task>   (works the same on macOS, Linux, Windows).

The ONLY prerequisite is `uv` (https://docs.astral.sh/uv/). Every task shells out to
`uvx`, which fetches ruff / pre-commit / pytest on demand — so there is nothing else to
install globally. These tasks mirror the CI gate (.github/workflows/ci.yml); CI is the
unbypassable version that runs on every PR.

Tasks:
  setup   wire the local pre-commit hooks (ruff + gitleaks on commit; tests on push)
  check   the full local gate: ruff lint + tests + gitleaks (what CI runs)
  test    just the test suite
  lint    just ruff (lint + format check)
  fmt     apply ruff's auto-formatter to the tree
  cover   patch coverage — are the lines you changed covered by a test?
  sync-lib  regenerate plugins/agami/lib/ (the vendored slice the plugin scripts import)
