# agami model

You are running the unified **model + trust** surface — one dashboard to browse the live semantic model, curate it (exclude / edit / add), AND sign off the trust layer (approve / reject metrics, entities, joins). It replaces the separate model-explorer and review-dashboard surfaces.

This skill orchestrates:

1. **Render** — invoke `render_model_explorer.py` to walk every YAML and write a self-contained HTML artifact at `<artifacts_dir>/local/model/<profile>/<ts>.html`. The Python script does the YAML reading — **no LLM tokens spent on the walk**. The dashboard has tabs: **Organization · Review · Subject areas · Tables · Metrics · Entities · Joins · Examples · Queued**. The **Review** tab is the sign-off queue (the old `/agami-review`); pass `--initial-tab review` to open on it.
2. **Open + wait** — auto-open the file, end the turn, wait for the user to come back with a "Generate feedback for Claude" block (exclude/include, approve/reject, edits, new metrics, org edit).
3. **Apply** — for each batch, run `semantic_model.cli curate` with an ops JSON. The engine flips review_state / stamps sign-off, runs the validator, reverts via git on failure, appends to `curation_log.jsonl`, and commits.
4. **Re-render** — render to a new timestamped file and re-open. Wait for the next batch.

Trust-spine semantics — three actions on the same `review_state` field:
- **Exclude / Reject** → `rejected`. The loader drops rejected tables, columns, metrics, entities, and relationships entirely (`include_rejected=False` at runtime) — never in prompts, never joined, never aggregated. ("Exclude" is the verb for tables/columns; "Reject" for metrics/entities/joins — same op.)
- **Include** → back to `unreviewed`.
- **Approve** → `approved` + a sign-off stamp (`signed_off_by`/`_at`/`_role`). **Rule 1** (metrics) — a query that uses an unsigned metric still answers but carries a "not signed off" **warning** on its receipt until it's approved; **Rule 2** (entities, inferred joins) is usable while unreviewed and self-approves through use. Only `rejected` entries are dropped from the runtime entirely. Approving requires the curator's email + role (Phase 0) — the validator rejects an approved entry with no sign-off stamp.

## Conversation style

- **Tight loops.** The dashboard is the surface; the chat is just the input channel.
- **Don't restate the dashboard in chat.** A successful apply gets a one-line ack with the count and the new file path.
- **Qualified names everywhere.** Tables are `<area>.<table>`. Columns are `<area>.<table>.<column>` (area = subject area). No bare names.

---

## Phase 0: Preflight

- **Plan-mode check** — this skill writes YAMLs. If plan mode is active, refuse: *"I can't apply model edits in plan mode — switch to **Auto** or **Edit Automatically** mode (Shift+Tab to cycle) and re-invoke. (You can still inspect a previously-rendered dashboard at `<artifacts_dir>/local/model/<profile>/<ts>.html`.)"* **Do NOT write a plan file. Do NOT call `ExitPlanMode`.**
- **Resolve `<profile>` and `<artifacts_dir>`** via the standard chain (`AGAMI_PROFILE` → `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config.active_profile` → `default`; `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` → `.config.artifacts_dir` → `~/agami-artifacts`).
  - **A pasted feedback block names its own target.** When applying a block from the dashboard's "Generate feedback for Claude", its first line is `profile: <name>` — that dashboard was rendered for THAT model, so **use it and override the active-profile default.** It prevents applying e.g. a ServiceNow dashboard's approvals to whatever happens to be the active profile (`meridian`, etc.). If `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/org.yaml` exists for the named profile, target it directly — don't fall back to `active_profile` or hunt with `find`.
- **If `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/org.yaml` doesn't exist**, invoke `agami-connect` and stop — there's no model to explore yet.
- **Verify Python + PyYAML are importable** (the renderer + applier both depend on PyYAML): `python3 -c 'import yaml'`. If not, surface the install hint and stop.

**Scope / initial tab.** Look at `$ARGUMENTS`:
- `review`, `preseed`, or `rule1` → the user wants the sign-off queue: render with `--initial-tab review` so the dashboard opens on the Review tab. (`preseed`/`rule1` come from `/agami-connect`'s Phase 4 gate — the Review tab already groups Rule 1 metrics under "Needs your eyes", so no separate scope filter is needed; the user signs those off there.)
- otherwise → no `--initial-tab` (opens on Tables).

**Resolve the curator's identity** (needed to stamp sign-off on Approve ops, and for `curation_log.jsonl` + git commits). The **primary path is the dashboard's footer** — the user types their email + picks a role there, and it rides back on the `signed-off-by:` feedback line (Phase 2). So you usually don't ask at all. Only if a batch arrives with approvals but **no** `signed-off-by:` line, fall back to `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` (`reviewer_email`/`reviewer_role`); and only if those are absent too, ask once — both at once:
> To sign off entries I need your email and role. Reply like: `you@company.com / data_lead`
>
> Roles: `CFO`, `CTO`, `Data Lead`, `Engineer`, `Analyst`, or type your own.
>
> I'll save these to `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` so I don't ask again.

Parse on `/`, trim, validate email against `\S+@\S+\.\S+`; accept any non-empty role string (≤ 40 chars). Re-prompt only on a bad email. **Persist** by merging `reviewer_email`/`reviewer_role` into `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` (preserve existing keys), then `chmod 600 <artifacts_dir>/local/.config`. **Do NOT infer the email from any source** — not git config / env / credentials, **and not the Claude Code login / session email** (the host exposes it, but using it produces a silently-wrong audit trail). The sign-off identity must be typed by the user; don't even pre-fill the domain. Exclude/edit-only sessions don't need the role — only resolve it lazily when an Approve is in the batch.

---

## Phase 1: Render the explorer

```bash
ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
# Per-profile subdir so multi-profile users can tell renders apart.
mkdir -p <artifacts_dir>/local/model/"$profile"
out="<artifacts_dir>/local/model/$profile/$ts.html"
python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/render_model_explorer.py" \
  --profile "$profile" \
  --artifacts-dir "$artifacts_dir" \
  ${initial_tab:+--initial-tab "$initial_tab"} \
  --out "$out"
```

Set `initial_tab=review` when `$ARGUMENTS` was `review`/`preseed`/`rule1` (Phase 0) to force the sign-off queue. **Leave it empty for a plain `/agami-model`** — the renderer then uses its **smart `auto` default**: it opens on **Review** when anything needs sign-off (unreviewed metrics/entities/joins, or columns agami couldn't read), and on **Tables** when the model is all clean (so the user never lands on an empty Review tab). `$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT` is the plugin dir under `~/.claude/plugins/cache/<marketplace>/agami/`. If the env var isn't set, fall back to the conventional install paths described in [`shared/invocation-conventions.md`](../../shared/invocation-conventions.md).

**Surface in chat (single block, no padding):**

```
Model dashboard rendered — <N> schema(s) · <M> tables · <K> fields · <R> to review.
<artifacts_dir>/local/model/<profile>/<ts>.html

Tabs: Organization · Review · Subject areas · Tables · Metrics · Entities ·
Joins · Examples · Queued. Live search + status filters per tab.
• Review tab — the sign-off queue: Approve / Reject the metrics (must be
  signed off before queries use them), entities, and inferred joins, with a
  one-click "Approve all" for the confident ones.
• Tables/Metrics/… — browse + edit; Exclude tables/columns you don't want
  queried (a column offers "exclude all N named <col>" to drop it everywhere);
  add metrics; edit ORGANIZATION.md.
Click through, hit "Generate feedback for Claude" at the bottom, paste back here.

You can also type commands directly:
  exclude tables:  <area>.<table>, <area>.<table>
  exclude columns: <area>.<table>.<column>, <area>.<table>.<column>
  curate-ops: [{"op":"approve","kind":"metric","area":"...","name":"...","at":"<UTC ISO>"}, ...]
  done
```

**Auto-open with the standard multi-command fallback chain:**

```bash
( command -v open    >/dev/null 2>&1 && open "$out" ) || \
( command -v xdg-open >/dev/null 2>&1 && xdg-open "$out" ) || \
( command -v start    >/dev/null 2>&1 && start "$out" ) || \
( command -v cmd      >/dev/null 2>&1 && cmd /c start "" "$out" ) || \
echo "agami: couldn't auto-open the explorer — open manually: $out"
```

End the turn. Wait for the user.

---

## Phase 2: Parse the chat back-channel

The user replies with a block like:

```
exclude tables: sales.STG_LEADS, sales.STG_RAW
exclude columns: sales.CUSTOMERS.SSN, sales.CUSTOMERS.EMAIL
include tables: sales.PAYMENTS
done
```

Grammar:

```
signed-off-by: you@company.com / data_lead
exclude tables:  <qname-list>
include tables:  <qname-list>
exclude columns: <qname-list>
include columns: <qname-list>
curate-ops:
[{"op":"approve","kind":"metric","area":"...","name":"...","at":"<UTC ISO>"}, {"op":"exclude","kind":"metric","area":"...","name":"..."}, {"op":"edit","kind":"table","area":"...","name":"orders","column":"amount","field":"description","value":"..."}, ...]
example-edits:
[{"area":"sales","question":"...","sql":"...","source":"correction","status":"confirmed"}]
new-metrics:
[{"area":"sales","name":"repeat_rate","description":"...","calculation":"...","bindings":{"Snowflake":"..."},"source_tables":["orders"],"other_names":["repeat purchase rate"],"unit":"percent","confidence":"proposed"}]
new-examples:
[{"area":"sales","question":"How many active vehicles by zone?","sql":"SELECT zone, COUNT(*) ...","source":"human","status":"confirmed"}]
organization-md: "<full new ORGANIZATION.md text, JSON-encoded>"
key-terminology: {"gold tier": "lifetime spend > $10k", "churned": "no order in 90 days"}
done
```

Where `<qname-list>` is comma-separated, whitespace-tolerant:
- Table qname: `<area>.<table>` (e.g., `sales.STG_LEADS`)
- Column qname: `<area>.<table>.<column>` (e.g., `sales.CUSTOMERS.EMAIL`)

A header line + several optional blocks may follow (the dashboard emits whichever applies — `curate-ops`, `example-edits`, `new-metrics`, `new-examples`, `organization-md`, `key-terminology`):
- **`signed-off-by: <email> / <role>`** (header, present only when the batch has approvals) — the curator's sign-off identity, entered at the top of the dashboard's Review tab. **Use it for `--signer`/`--role`** when applying, and **persist** `reviewer_email`/`reviewer_role` into `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` (preserve other keys; `chmod 600`) so future sessions don't re-ask. If a batch contains approvals but this line is **absent**, fall back to `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` (`reviewer_email`/`reviewer_role`), then to the Phase 0 ask. Validate the email against `\S+@\S+\.\S+`; the role is a short free-text string (the picker offers CFO / CTO / Data Lead / Engineer / Analyst, but "Other" lets the user type their own — accept any non-empty value ≤ 40 chars; don't reject a custom role).
- **`curate-ops:`** — the unified ops array. Holds **approve / reject(exclude) / include** on metrics/entities/relationships AND field **edits** (`op:"edit"` with `field`/`value`). Already a valid curate ops array; merge it verbatim with the table/column ops below and apply via one `sm curate` call. **`approve` ops carry an `at` timestamp** (the dashboard stamps it) and require the curator's `--signer`/`--role` from the `signed-off-by:` line — the validator rejects an approved entry with no sign-off stamp. **Rule 1 guard:** before applying an `approve` on a metric, confirm its `calculation` is non-empty (the dashboard always has one for user-authored metrics; for an introspected metric with an empty calculation, ask the user to fill it via an `edit` first).
- **`example-edits:`** — edited prompt examples `[{area, question, sql, source, status}]`. Group by `area` and apply each group with `sm add-example "$ROOT" --area <area> --file <json>` (it dedups by `question`, so an edit replaces the prior example). Write the per-area JSON with the **Write tool**.
- **`new-metrics:`** — metrics the user authored in the dashboard's "Add metric" form `[{area, name, description, calculation, bindings, source_tables, other_names, unit?, confidence}]`. Group by `area` and create each group with `sm add "$ROOT" --kind metric --area <area> --file <json>` (validates each item, writes `subject_areas/<area>/metrics/<slug>.yaml`, reverts the batch on failure). Write the per-area JSON with the **Write tool** — it's already in the `sm add` shape, so pass it through verbatim. A user-authored metric is `confidence: proposed` and still needs sign-off (approve it on the Review tab).
- **`new-examples:`** — NL→SQL examples the user authored in the dashboard's "Add an example" form `[{area, question, sql, source, status}]` (`source: human`, `status: confirmed`). Same shape + apply path as `example-edits:` — group by `area` and apply each group with `sm add-example "$ROOT" --area <area> --file <json>` (Write the per-area JSON with the **Write tool**; it dedups by `question`, appending new ones to `prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml`). A human-authored example is trusted (`status: confirmed`) — no sign-off needed.
- **`organization-md:`** — a JSON-encoded string of the full new `ORGANIZATION.md`. JSON-decode it and **Write** it to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/ORGANIZATION.md` (overwrite; free-form Markdown, no validator). This is the human **narrative only** — it never carries the glossary or model facts.
- **`key-terminology:`** — a JSON object `{term: definition, …}`: the curated domain glossary the user edited in the Organization tab. It's the **complete** intended glossary (adds, edits, and removals already applied), so write it to a temp file and apply with **`--replace`** (it's validated + committed, reverts on failure):
  ```bash
  bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" set-terminology "$ROOT" --file /tmp/agami-terminology.json --replace
  ```
  Write the JSON with the **Write tool**. This lands in the structured `key_terminology` field (not ORGANIZATION.md) and surfaces in the derived domain context automatically.

Show the user a one-line summary of what each block changed before applying.

Tolerate trailing commas, mixed-case schema/table/column names (the YAMLs typically preserve the DB's casing — pass them through verbatim).

**Reject malformed targets in chat, not by silently dropping them.** If a user types `exclude tables: STG_LEADS` without the schema prefix, surface: *"Tables need a schema prefix — `sales.STG_LEADS` not just `STG_LEADS`. Did you mean that?"* and stop.

---

## Phase 3: Apply via the curation engine

Translate the parsed table/column exclude/include commands into curation ops, **then merge in the `curate-ops:` JSON array verbatim** (it already holds the approve / reject / include / edit ops for metrics, entities, and joins). Table targets are `<area>.<table>`, column targets `<area>.<table>.<column>`. `exclude` → `op: exclude` (engine treats it as reject), `include` → `op: include`, `approve` → `op: approve` (+ `at`):

```json
[
  {"op": "exclude", "kind": "table", "area": "sales", "name": "STG_LEADS"},
  {"op": "exclude", "kind": "table", "area": "sales", "name": "CUSTOMERS", "column": "EMAIL"},
  {"op": "approve", "kind": "metric", "area": "sales", "name": "total_revenue", "at": "2026-06-10T17:51:41Z"},
  {"op": "reject",  "kind": "entity", "area": "sales", "name": "region"},
  {"op": "approve", "kind": "relationship", "area": "sales", "name": "orders->customers", "at": "2026-06-10T17:51:41Z"}
]
```

(Column exclusions use `kind: table` + a `column` field — the engine flips the column inside that table's YAML.) **Write the ops array to the file with the Write tool — never a heredoc, a shell variable (`printf "$OPS"`), or `python3 -c` (JSON quotes/`null` break those).** Then apply the whole batch atomically — the engine flips `review_state` / stamps sign-off, **validates the model, commits, logs to `curation_log.jsonl`, and reverts everything on validation failure**:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate "$ROOT" \
  --ops-file /tmp/agami-model-ops.json \
  --signer "${reviewer_email}" --role "${reviewer_role}"
```

`ROOT="<artifacts_dir>/<profile>"`. `--signer`/`--role` come from Phase 0 (resolve them before applying if the batch has any `approve` op — the validator rejects an approved entry with no sign-off stamp). Stdout is JSON: `{applied, skipped, errors, validated, committed}`.

**Success** (`validated: true`):
- Ack with the counts that apply, e.g. *"✓ Applied: approved 4, rejected 1, 2 columns excluded, 1 edit. Re-rendering…"*
- List any `skipped[]` (bad target / not found) on their own lines.
- Continue to Phase 4 (re-render).

**Failure** (`validated: false`):
- The engine already reverted via git. Surface: *"⚠ Validator rejected the batch — all changes reverted. No files were modified."* Show `errors` verbatim. Stop; don't re-render.

Excluded entries vanish from the runtime model (the loader drops `review_state: rejected`) but stay visible in the explorer (which loads with `include_rejected=True`) so the user can re-include them.

---

## Phase 4: Re-render

Every successful apply produces a new explorer file at a new timestamp.

**Delete the previous timestamped file from this profile's dir before writing the new one** (`rm -f "<artifacts_dir>/local/model/$profile/$prev_ts.html"`). Track `$prev_ts` across re-renders. The auto-open of the new file is the refresh signal; old files just accumulate and confuse the user about which tab is current.

```bash
new_ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
new_out="<artifacts_dir>/local/model/$profile/$new_ts.html"
python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/render_model_explorer.py" \
  --profile "$profile" --artifacts-dir "$artifacts_dir" --out "$new_out"
```

Auto-open the new path. Surface the new file path in the chat ack:

```
✓ Applied: 2 tables excluded, 2 columns excluded. Re-rendered.
<artifacts_dir>/local/model/<profile>/<new-ts>.html
(Previous tab is stale and can be closed.)
```

End the turn. The user comes back with the next batch.

---

## Phase 5: Closing

When the user types `done` AND no further commands are in the message, surface:

```
✓ Model exploration session ended. Final state:
  <X> tables excluded · <Y> columns excluded across the profile.

The runtime semantic model now skips these entries — they will not
appear in any prompt or join. To restore them later, run /agami-model
and queue `include tables: ...` / `include columns: ...`.
```

Then end the turn. The skill is one-shot per invocation — re-enter via the slash command or natural-language phrase to start another session.

---

## Edge cases

| Case | Behavior |
|---|---|
| User types `exclude tables: schema.table` for a table that's already excluded | The applier still runs (idempotent flip to rejected with the curator's name on the curation log). No-op for the YAML, but the audit trail records the re-confirm. |
| User types `include tables: schema.table` for a table that's already unreviewed | Same — idempotent flip; entry stays unreviewed; curator name recorded. |
| User types `exclude columns: schema.table.col` and the column doesn't exist | The applier returns it in `skipped[]` with reason "field not found on dataset". Surface the skip; continue with the rest. |
| User types `exclude tables: schema.table.col` (3 segments — looks like a column) | The grammar is positional; agami treats the `exclude tables:` prefix as authoritative. The applier will fail to find a table with that 3-segment name and return `skipped` with reason "table yaml not found". Surface clearly. |
| Validator fails on a partially-applied batch | The applier reverts ALL YAML changes via `git checkout -- .` before returning. `applied` counts are zeroed in the response (defense against partial-apply confusion). The user sees `validator_output` verbatim and can fix + retry. |
| User has the profile dir but no `.git/` (legacy from before Phase 3e) | The applier skips the git commit + revert steps silently. Curation log still gets appended. The user loses revert-on-validator-fail safety — surface a one-liner suggesting `git init` in the profile dir. |
| The model has 5000+ fields | The renderer handles it (JSON manifest is ~hundreds of KB at the high end). Client-side search is instant up to the millions of DOM nodes mark. If it gets sluggish, file an issue. |

---

## What the runtime does with `rejected` entries

The trust spine has always read `agami.review_state`. The model loader in [`plugins/agami/skills/agami-query/SKILL.md → Phase 1c`](../agami-query/SKILL.md#1c--index-the-model-for-fast-access) filters entries with `review_state: rejected` out of `datasets_by_name`, `datasets_by_qname`, `fields_by_qname`, and `relationships_by_endpoints`. Rejected entries:

- **Never appear in the schema context** the SQL generator sees (Phase 2b).
- **Are not joinable** — the join-path picker skips relationships whose endpoints reference a rejected dataset.
- **Dropped from the runtime** — a *rejected* metric or named filter is excluded entirely; a query that would have referenced one gets a "metric not found" path, not an error. (An *unreviewed* metric is different — it's still used, just with a receipt warning.)
- **Stay in the YAML** for audit. The user can `include` them later without re-introspect.

Reject (on the Review tab or any metric/entity/join card) and Exclude (on tables/columns) are the same `rejected` operation — this dashboard is the one surface for both the bulk tables-as-units curation and the per-entry sign-off.

## Examples

### Excluding PII columns

```
You: open the model explorer

[skill renders <artifacts_dir>/local/model/main/20260512-101500.html and opens it]

You (in dashboard): search "ssn" → toggle Exclude on every SSN/EMAIL
                    field → click Generate feedback → paste back in chat:

exclude columns: sales.CUSTOMERS.SSN,
                 sales.CUSTOMERS.EMAIL,
                 sales.STG_LEADS.SSN
done

[skill applies, validator passes, commits, re-renders]

agami: ✓ Applied: 3 columns excluded. Re-rendered.
       <artifacts_dir>/local/model/main/20260512-101830.html
```

### Removing staging tables

```
You: I never want agami to use the staging tables

[skill checks ORGANIZATION.md / table names for `_stg` suffix; if
 unsure, asks: "I see CUSTOMER_SCORE_STG — anything else? Click
 Exclude on the table cards in the dashboard."]

[user excludes via dashboard, pastes back]
exclude tables: sales.CUSTOMER_SCORE_STG
done

agami: ✓ Applied: 1 table excluded.
```
