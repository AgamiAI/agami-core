name: agami-connect
description: "End-to-end database connection for agami: sets up credentials on first run (DB-type picker → writes <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example for the user to fill in), then introspects the live DB directly into the agami semantic model (subject areas, tables, columns, relationships with join cardinality, deep-table column groups, sensitive-column flags) under <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/. The structural model is built deterministically by the agami-core semantic_model package (catalog mode, or a probe-mode fallback when the catalog is locked down); the skill then layers LLM enrichment (descriptions, entities, metrics) and seeds EXPLAIN-validated NL→SQL examples. Every model write is gated by the semantic-model validator — no breaking model is ever persisted."
when_to_use: "Run when the user installs the plugin for the first time, asks 'how do I set up agami' / 'connect to my database' / 'introspect my database' / 'introspect the schema' / 'reload schema' / 'add a new database', wants to try agami WITHOUT a database ('I don't have a database', 'try the sample', 'use the sample data', 'demo data'), or after the user changes their schema and wants the model refreshed. Also auto-invoked by agami-query the first time it runs (when the semantic model is missing). This skill handles credential setup, introspection, enrichment, and seed-example validation — one entry point for everything before the user can query. The sample-database path (Phase 0s) needs no connection and lands a queryable model in under a minute."

# agami connect

**Before suggesting any slash command in chat, read [`shared/invocation-conventions.md`](../../shared/invocation-conventions.md).** Agami slash commands: `/agami-connect`, `/agami-query`, `/agami-model`, `/agami-save-correction`, `/agami-reconcile`. (`/agami-model` is also the trust-review surface — its Review tab absorbed the former `/agami-review`.) Never write the un-prefixed forms (`/init`, `/connect`, etc.) or colon forms (`/agami:connect`) — those don't exist. For chat replies, prefer natural language ("say 'reload the schema'", "say 'introspect my database'") — the `when_to_use` matcher routes correctly without an explicit slash command.

You are setting up the agami **semantic model** for the user's database. Goal: by the end there is a validated semantic model at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/` (`org.yaml` + `subject_areas/<area>/…` + `datasources/<connection>/storage.yaml`), a seeded examples library at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/prompt_examples/<area>/examples.yaml`, an `ORGANIZATION.md` the user can edit, and the user has seen one demo query execute end-to-end.

**The structural model is built by a deterministic engine, not hand-authored.** `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" introspect` introspects the live DB across all supported dialects — **PostgreSQL (incl. Supabase / Redshift), MySQL/MariaDB, Snowflake, BigQuery, SQL Server, Oracle, Databricks, Trino/Presto, DuckDB, SQLite** — into the model: storage connection, proposed subject areas, tables, columns + types, primary-key grain, foreign-key relationships **with join cardinality**, `column_groups` on wide tables, and `sensitive` flags on PII. When the catalog (`information_schema` / PRAGMA / data-dictionary) is reachable it runs in **catalog mode**; when a locked-down role denies the catalog it falls back **per-capability to probe mode** (describe via a zero-row header, infer types from a value sample, grain from uniqueness probes, FKs from name+overlap) and everything inferred lands `unreviewed` for sign-off. Your job is the layer the engine can't do: **enrichment** (prose descriptions, entities, metrics, caveats) and **curation** (subject-area boundaries, trust review).

For the model format: [`semantic_model/__init__.py`](../../../../packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/__init__.py) (layout) and the Pydantic models in `packages/agami-core/src/semantic_model/models.py`.
For credentials: [`shared/credentials-format.md`](../../shared/credentials-format.md).
For connection method + local execution: [`shared/connection-reference.md`](../../shared/connection-reference.md).
For DB error classification: [`shared/db_error_classifier.md`](../../shared/db_error_classifier.md).

## Conversation style

- **Combine acknowledge + next question** — don't waste turns on "Got it!"
- **Use AskUserQuestion for every Yes/No/Skip** — never inline-bullet options. Use `(Recommended)` only when there's a genuine recommendation. For fact-of-environment questions ("which database type?", "which schemas?"), don't mark any option Recommended — the user picks what they have.
- **Every multiSelect needs an explicit "none / continue" option** — `AskUserQuestion` cannot be submitted with zero boxes checked, so any multiSelect where "pick nothing" is a valid answer MUST offer a selectable "Nothing — continue" (or "Keep everything") option. Never phrase the prompt as "leave all unchecked" — that's unsubmittable and traps the user.
- **Keep the user oriented** — print one-line progress markers between phases (`✓ Introspected 12 tables`, `✓ Validator passed`, `✓ Generated 10 examples`).
- **Plain voice — state what happened, never how impressive it is.** Progress markers, todo labels, and narration describe the action and the result; they do NOT editorialize. Banned: "wow moment", "magic", "watch this", "the exciting part", "you'll love this", exclamation hype. The reader is a data professional — a query running correctly speaks for itself. Say *"Running the first query"*, not *"Now the wow moment"*.

## Progress tracking — set up a todo list at the very start

This is a multi-phase skill that often takes 5–15 minutes end-to-end. **The very first action on every invocation is to call `TodoWrite`** with the skill's major phases, so the user can watch progress. Validated as a strong UX signal — it makes the wait feel intentional rather than opaque.

Seed (one task per major phase, in order):

```
1. Preflight: credentials check + tool detection
2. Discover & prune: list tables + columns, user prunes what they don't need
3. Introspect the KEPT tables → semantic model (engine: grain, FK cardinality)
4. Enrich: descriptions, entities, metrics (LLM, validated into the model)
5. Curate before examples: exclude columns/tables + sign off metrics & entities
6. Generate seed NL→SQL examples (validated against the live DB)
7. Validate every seed example (user reviews via dashboard)
8. Post-introspect trust summary
9. Follow-up suggestions
```

Use `content` for the imperative form and `activeForm` for the present-continuous form. **Mark each todo `in_progress` when its phase starts and `completed` immediately when it ends.** Exactly one `in_progress` at a time.

**Skip the seeding if the todo list already contains these items** (the skill is resuming after Phase 0 wrote the credentials template and waited). When `$ARGUMENTS == reintrospect`, the same todos apply.

---

## Phase −1: Plan-mode check

Run the detection + ask logic from [`shared/plan-mode-check.md`](../../shared/plan-mode-check.md). agami-connect needs Bash (introspection) and Write (model files) — both blocked in plan mode.

**If plan mode is active and the user stays in plan mode** (or the skill is invoked under plan mode with no prompt): refuse with the one-liner below and **end the turn**. DO NOT write a plan file. DO NOT call `ExitPlanMode`.

> I can't introspect in plan mode — switch to **Auto** or **Edit Automatically** mode (Shift+Tab to cycle) and re-invoke me. Introspection, enrichment, and the demo query all need write access to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`.

If plan mode is not active, skip silently.

---

## Phase 0: Preflight

### HARD RULES — read before doing anything

Non-negotiable. They override every other instruction here when they conflict.

1. **Connect ONLY to the host/port/database/user/password in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials`.** That file is the sole credential source — there is no env-var bypass. Never connect to anything else. Never probe `localhost` unless the credentials say so. Never substitute defaults for missing fields.
2. **Never ask the user for connection values (host / port / user / password / token / DSN) in chat.** Not even temporarily. The single authorized credential path is **Phase 0a**, which writes a `credentials.example` template the user fills in and saves. Phase 0a never reads secrets inline — it writes a template, surfaces a hand-off, and ends the turn.
3. **Never scan or guess.** No `pgrep`, `ps`, `lsof`, `find /`, `ls /Applications`, no port-listener scans, no testing connections to common hostnames. The only acceptable Bash probes here are `which <tool>` and `python3 -c 'import <module>'`.
4. **If credentials are missing for the active profile, run Phase 0a.** After the user fills in the template they re-invoke (or just ask a data question — `agami-query` auto-invokes us).
5. **NEVER put a credential on a Bash command line** — no `export PGPASSWORD=…`, no `psql -W <pw>`, no heredoc that interpolates a secret. Hosts render Bash calls in chat; anything on the line leaks. Runtime queries use the auth files from `scripts/setup_pgauth.py` (psql/mysql) or `python -m execute_sql` (every driver, reads `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials` itself). See [`shared/connection-reference.md → HARD RULES`](../../shared/connection-reference.md).

If you reach for a command that doesn't fit, stop and re-read this section.

### Preflight steps

0. **Sample-path short-circuit (check FIRST, before resolving any profile).** If the user explicitly asked for the sample — `$ARGUMENTS` is `sample`, or they said *"try the sample"* / *"I don't have a database"* / *"use the sample (or example) data"* / *"demo data"* — then bind `$PROFILE_NAME = agami-example`, `$DB_TYPE = sample`, and **go straight to [Phase 0s](#phase-0s-sample-database-bootstrap-no-connection)**. Do this **regardless of any existing `active_profile` or onboarded profiles** — the sample is a deliberate, explicit choice and must not be intercepted by another profile's credential/existing-model checks. (This is why the option in 0a.2 isn't enough on its own: a returning user with an onboarded profile never reaches 0a.) If `agami-example` is already set up, Phase 0s sends them to the demo. Only fall through to step 1 when there's **no** sample signal.
1. **Resolve the environment** — `python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/connect_resolve.py" [--db-type <t>] [--profile <p>]` prints `{data, anomalies}` (self-describing JSON): profile, artifacts_dir, the `[<profile>]` credentials section + chmod, the cached config, the **scored** `interpreter.python3` (the one with model deps + driver — use it everywhere; never a Python missing a dep), native `tools`, and a `next` decision. Branch on `data.next`: **`ready`** → continue (Phase 1 / existing-model check); **`promote`** → run 0a.10 to promote the filled template, then continue; **`bootstrap`** → run Phase 0a and stop. On a first-time bootstrap `data.profile` is **`null`** (`profile_source: "default"`) — there's no profile yet, so narrate it **without a name**: *"No credentials yet — first-time setup."* (Never say "profile `main`" — the user names their profile in 0a.3.) Only when `data.profile` is non-null (a `bootstrap` for an explicitly-named/env profile) may you name it. Surface `anomalies` (e.g. `credentials_world_readable` → offer `chmod 600`); never substitute a `missing_fields` value — surface "missing field X for profile Y" and stop.
2. **Update-check (best-effort).** Run the probe from [`shared/version-check.md`](../../shared/version-check.md); surface a one-liner if a newer version exists. Never block on network failure.
3. If `$ARGUMENTS` is `reintrospect`: re-introspect from scratch, but **preserve hand-edits** (descriptions, entities, metrics, caveats, trust sign-offs). The engine writes the structural skeleton; merge it over the existing enrichment rather than discarding it (see Phase 2's reintrospect note).

---

## Phase 0a: First-time credential bootstrap

**Runs only when preflight step 1 returns `next: bootstrap` (no credentials for the profile).** If `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials` already has the `[<profile>]` section, **skip Phase 0a entirely.**

### 0a.1 — Set up `<artifacts_dir>/local/`
```bash
mkdir -p "<artifacts_dir>/local" && chmod 700 "<artifacts_dir>/local"
```
If the user chose a non-default `<artifacts_dir>`, **persist the pointer** so future sessions find it, and gitignore `local/`:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/agami && printf '%s\n' "<artifacts_dir>" > ~/.config/agami/path
grep -qxF 'local/' "<artifacts_dir>/.gitignore" 2>/dev/null || printf 'local/\n' >> "<artifacts_dir>/.gitignore"
```

### 0a.2 — Ask the database type

**AskUserQuestion** (no `(Recommended)` — fact-of-environment). The **first** option is always the no-database sample path; cap the rest at 4 visible + Other.

**Name the Other-only engines in the QUESTION PROMPT** so they're visibly supported — the auto-provided "Other" field can't carry its own description/examples, so the examples must live in the prompt. End the prompt with a line like:
> *Something else — BigQuery, SQL Server, Oracle, Databricks, Trino/Presto, DuckDB, or SQLite? Choose **Other** and type it (a name or a full DSN).*

| label | description |
|---|---|
| `Try a sample database — no connection needed` | Don't have a database handy (or not ready to connect one)? agami ships a small **Acme Store** SQLite dataset (commerce + subscriptions) with a ready-made model — query it in under a minute, nothing leaves your machine. |
| `PostgreSQL` | Postgres + compatible: Supabase, Neon, RDS, Aurora, Cloud SQL, Timescale, and **Amazon Redshift** (port 5439, SSL by default). |
| `MySQL` | MySQL, MariaDB, RDS MySQL, PlanetScale. |
| `Snowflake` | Snowflake. Account identifier instead of host. |
| `Other (Other field)` | **BigQuery, SQL Server, Oracle, Databricks, Trino/Presto, DuckDB, SQLite**, or paste any DSN. |

Bind `$DB_TYPE` ∈ `sample | postgres | mysql | snowflake | bigquery | sqlserver | oracle | databricks | trino | duckdb | sqlite | dsn`.

**Routing:**
- **`Try a sample database`** (or the user says *"I don't have a database"* / *"try the sample"* / runs `agami-connect sample`) → bind `$DB_TYPE = sample`, set `$PROFILE_NAME = agami-example`, and **jump straight to [Phase 0s](#phase-0s-sample-database-bootstrap-no-connection)** — skip the rest of 0a (no credential template, no hand-off turn; the connection is known).
- `PostgreSQL` → `postgres`; if the user later enters port `5439` or a `*.redshift.*.amazonaws.com` host, transparently re-bind to `redshift`. A `*.pooler.supabase.com` host stays `postgres` (Supabase is hosted Postgres).
- `MySQL`/`Snowflake` → pass-through. `BigQuery` lives under **Other** now (or the user types it) → `bigquery`.
- `Other` → parse the free-form input: a DSN scheme → derive `db_type`; `.db`/`.sqlite`/`.duckdb` suffix or absolute file path → SQLite or DuckDB; a named DB (`bigquery`, `sqlserver`/`mssql`, `oracle`, `databricks`, `trino`/`presto`, `duckdb`) → that dialect. Only refuse with "not supported yet" for engines outside the supported set above (e.g. MongoDB, Cassandra, ClickHouse).

### 0a.3 — Name the database profile (the user's choice)

Ask the user to **name** this connection — don't pick for them. The name is how they'll switch databases later (`AGAMI_PROFILE=<name>`) and it names the model folder (`<artifacts_dir>/<name>/`), so a name that means something to them — their database, product, team, or environment — beats a generic default.

**AskUserQuestion**, with the **Other** free-text as the encouraged path (that's where they type their own name):
> What should I call this database? Pick a name you'll recognize when you connect more than one — e.g. your database or product name, or an environment.

Offer a few *examples* as options (`prod`, `staging`, `analytics`) but make clear in the prompt that typing their own in **Other** is the point — **don't present a `main` default that nudges them past the choice.** Bind `$PROFILE_NAME` to their answer (the Other text, or a picked example). Validate: lowercase letters/digits/dashes/underscores, 1–32 chars; **and not already a `[section]` in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials`** (a profile name is a unique key — reusing one would clash). If it fails either rule, show the reason and re-ask. (The 0a.10 promote helper enforces the uniqueness backstop too — it returns `COLLISION` rather than overwrite — but catch it here so the user isn't surprised later.)

### 0a.4 — Write `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example`

Use the **Write tool**. Shared header first, then the `$DB_TYPE` body with `[$PROFILE_NAME]` as the section.

**Header:**
```ini
# <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example
# Fill in your values below, then come back and say "introspect my database".
# agami moves this file to <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials and chmod-600s it for you — no
# manual save or chmod needed. (Don't rename it yourself.)
# agami only runs read-only SELECT queries, so a read-only database user is all it needs
# (and the safest thing to connect). Copy-paste GRANT SQL for your database:
# plugins/agami/shared/readonly-grants.md — or ask agami for "the read-only grant".
# Format reference: plugins/agami/shared/credentials-format.md
# Switch profiles with AGAMI_PROFILE=<name>.
```

Bodies — `postgres`, `redshift`, `snowflake`, `mysql`, `bigquery`, `sqlite` are unchanged from [`shared/credentials-format.md`](../../shared/credentials-format.md) (URL-form first for Postgres/MySQL/Redshift; account fields for Snowflake; `project`+`service_account_path` for BigQuery; `path` for SQLite). The new dialects:

```ini
# SQL Server / Azure SQL.
[$PROFILE_NAME]
type = sqlserver
host = your-server.database.windows.net
port = 1433
database = your-database
user = your-username
password = your-password
```
```ini
# Oracle.
[$PROFILE_NAME]
type = oracle
host = your-host.example.com
port = 1521
service_name = ORCLPDB1
user = your-username
password = your-password
# OR a full DSN:  dsn = host:1521/ORCLPDB1
```
```ini
# Databricks SQL warehouse.
[$PROFILE_NAME]
type = databricks
host = your-workspace.cloud.databricks.com
http_path = /sql/1.0/warehouses/abc123
token = dapiXXXXXXXXXXXX
# catalog = main      # optional Unity Catalog
```
```ini
# Trino / Presto.
[$PROFILE_NAME]
type = trino
host = your-coordinator.example.com
port = 8080
user = your-username
catalog = your_catalog
schema = your_schema
# password = ...       # uncomment for HTTPS + basic auth
```
```ini
# DuckDB (local file or in-memory).
[$PROFILE_NAME]
type = duckdb
path = /absolute/path/to/your.duckdb
```

Always finish with the additional-profiles hint (one commented block):
```ini

# Add more profiles by appending another [section]. Switch with AGAMI_PROFILE=<name>.
# [staging]
# type = postgres
# url  = postgresql://readonly:pass@staging-db.example.com:5432/mydb
```

For BigQuery / Databricks / any key-or-token file: remind the user to `chmod 600` it.

### 0a.5 — Resolve the agami interpreter + detect tools

**`$PY` = `data.interpreter.python3` from the Phase-0 `connect_resolve.py` call** — the ONE Python agami uses for the model *and* DB connections (introspection always runs `python -m execute_sql` under it on *every* tier, so the DB driver must live in it). It's already the **scored** pick — the candidate that has `pydantic`+`sqlglot`+`pyyaml` AND the `$DB_TYPE` driver — so there's no guessing and the user sets nothing. **Re-run `connect_resolve.py --db-type $DB_TYPE` now** that the DB type is known, so the interpreter is scored against the right driver and native tools are refreshed. It records as `tool_paths.python3` in 0a.7. (`AGAMI_PYTHON` is honored as a first-priority override but is never required.)

Native CLIs (optional fast path for *queries* — introspection doesn't use them) are in `data.tools` (`psql`/`mysql`/`snowsql`/`sqlite3`/`duckdb`/`bq`, `null` if absent), detected with `which` only. **Forbidden** elsewhere: `pgrep`/`ps`/`lsof`/`find /`/`ls /Applications`/port scans.

**If `data.interpreter.has_driver` is `false`** the `$DB_TYPE` driver isn't in `$PY` yet — confirm via AskUserQuestion, then `"$PY" -m pip install --user <package>` from the table (probe was already done in `$PY` by `connect_resolve.py`):

| `$DB_TYPE` | probe (`"$PY" -c '…'`) | pip package |
|---|---|---|
| postgres / redshift | `import psycopg2` | `psycopg2-binary` |
| mysql | `import pymysql` | `pymysql` |
| snowflake | `import snowflake.connector` | `snowflake-connector-python` |
| bigquery | `import google.cloud.bigquery` | `google-cloud-bigquery` |
| sqlserver | `import pymssql` | `pymssql` |
| oracle | `import oracledb` | `oracledb` |
| databricks | `from databricks import sql` | `databricks-sql-connector` |
| trino | `import trino` | `trino` |
| duckdb | `import duckdb` | `duckdb` |
| sqlite | stdlib — always present | — |

If the driver is missing, **confirm via AskUserQuestion**, then `"$PY" -m pip install --user <package>` (plain `pip install` fallback). Same "never install silently" convention as the model deps (0a.5b). Do this for `$PY` so `sm introspect` connects on the first try.

### 0a.5b — Ensure the semantic-model dependencies

The model (introspection, validation, traversal, curation — everything the `sm` wrapper drives) needs **`pydantic` + `sqlglot` + `pyyaml`** in the interpreter agami uses. Check the resolved interpreter (`$AGAMI_PYTHON` → `.config` `tool_paths.python3` → `python3`):

```bash
"$PY" -c 'import pydantic, sqlglot, yaml' 2>/dev/null && echo "model deps OK"
```

If they're present, continue. If missing, **confirm via AskUserQuestion before installing** (same convention as the DB-driver install above — agami never installs silently):
> agami needs the **agami-core** package (which pulls `pydantic`, `sqlglot`, `pyyaml`) to build and read the semantic model. Install it now? (one-time, user-site — `pip install --user`)

On **Yes**: `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" install` — the `sm` launcher is the single place that installs the agami-core library into the resolved interpreter (editable from a dev checkout, else the published package via PyPI or pinned git — so it works in a marketplace install with no `packages/` dir), and everything (`python -m execute_sql` / `python -m semantic_model.cli` / `sm`) then resolves it. On **No**: stop with *"Can't build the model without it — re-run when you're ready to install."* — don't proceed to introspect.

(The `sm` wrapper also self-installs these on first use as a safety net, but doing it here makes it explicit, confirmed, and at a predictable moment rather than mid-introspection.)

### 0a.6 — Ask for `<artifacts_dir>` (first run only)

**The folder is chosen once, on the very first onboarding, and reused for every profile thereafter.** Before asking, check whether it's already set: if the pointer `~/.config/agami/path` exists (non-empty) **or** `AGAMI_ARTIFACTS_DIR` is set **or** `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` already records `artifacts_dir`, **skip this question entirely** — reuse that path and continue to 0a.7. Only a brand-new install (none of those present) reaches the question below. This guarantees a second/third database lands as a sibling inside the same folder rather than re-prompting (and risking a fragmented, multi-folder setup).

Detect the OS once so the options are platform-native — `uname -s` (`Darwin` = macOS, `Linux` = Linux) or treat `$OS == Windows_NT` / a `MINGW*`/`MSYS*` uname as Windows. Then **AskUserQuestion** with the two defaults for that OS as named options (Recommended first). The auto-provided **Other** lets the user type any absolute path — so this both gives sensible options *and* allows a full custom path:

> Where should agami save your semantic model, examples, and preferences? This is the **parent** for ALL profiles — each lands in `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`. It's non-secret (no credentials) — point it inside a git repo to share the tuned model with your team. Credentials stay in `<artifacts_dir>/local/` regardless.

| OS | Option 1 — Recommended | Option 2 |
|---|---|---|
| macOS | `~/agami-artifacts` | `~/Documents/agami-artifacts` |
| Linux | `~/agami-artifacts` | `~/Documents/agami-artifacts` |
| Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\agami-artifacts` | `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\agami-artifacts` |

(For Other, suggest a team repo path as the example, e.g. `~/code/acme-data/agami`.) Expand `~` / `%USERPROFILE%` to an absolute path. Validate: absolute, not inside `<artifacts_dir>/local/`, parent creatable. Store the **resolved absolute path** in `.config.artifacts_dir`.

### 0a.7 — Write `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config`
```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "tier": "<cli | duckdb | python>",
  "active_profile": "$PROFILE_NAME",
  "artifacts_dir": "<resolved absolute path>",
  "tool_paths": { "psql": "...", "python3": "$PY" },
  "detected_at": "<ISO8601 UTC from `date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ`>"
}
```
`python3` MUST be the `$PY` resolved in 0a.5 (the interpreter that has both the model deps and the DB driver) — `sm` and the introspection engine read it from here, so recording the wrong one reintroduces the interpreter mismatch. `chmod 600 <artifacts_dir>/local/.config`.

### 0a.8 — Seed `<artifacts_dir>/USER_MEMORY.md` if missing
Create the parent (`mkdir -p && chmod 755`) and write the default seed (per [`shared/user-memory-format.md`](../../shared/user-memory-format.md)), `chmod 644`. Don't overwrite. Migrate a v1.1 `<artifacts_dir>/local/USER_MEMORY.md` if present.

### 0a.9 — Hand-off + END THE TURN
```
✓ <artifacts_dir>/local/ ready (chmod 700)
✓ Credentials template → <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example
✓ Tool detected: <tool> (<tier>)
✓ Artifacts dir: <resolved path>

Next:
1. Open <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example and fill in your real connection details
   (keep the filename as-is — don't rename it).
2. Come back and say "introspect my database" — I'll secure the file and run the
   full introspect → enrich → seed flow.

Tip: agami only runs read-only queries, so a read-only database user is all it needs
(and safest). Want the exact GRANT SQL for your database? Just ask.

Heads-up: a cold cloud warehouse (Snowflake especially) makes introspect the slow
step — ~5–15 min for a sizable account. Postgres / MySQL are seconds.
```
**End the turn.** Do NOT continue to Phase 1.

Show the read-only **Tip** line only for dialects with a user/role concept (`postgres`,
`redshift`, `mysql`, `snowflake`, `sqlserver`, `oracle`, `databricks`, `trino`); **omit** it for
`sqlite` / `duckdb` (file-based, no user) and when BigQuery auth is ADC. If the user asks for the
grant, read [`shared/readonly-grants.md`](../../shared/readonly-grants.md), pick the `$DB_TYPE`
block, and fill `<db>` / `<schema>` / `<user>` from the values they entered.

### 0a.10 — On re-entry: promote the filled-in template, then continue
The user filled in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example` and came back (or asked a data question / said "introspect my database"). **Promote it deterministically** with the helper — do NOT hand-roll an `mv`/append, and do NOT assume "no file yet." The script handles all four cases (first profile → move; Nth profile → append; name clash → refuse; placeholders → refuse), so the second-profile and `[main]`/`[main]` cases can't silently corrupt the file:

```bash
python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/promote_credentials.py"
```

Read the first token of stdout and act:
- `SECURED <profile>` → credentials created from the template (chmod 600, `.example` consumed). Continue.
- `APPENDED <profile>` → the new profile was appended to an existing credentials file (other profiles untouched, chmod 600). Continue.
- `COLLISION <profile>` → a profile by that name **already exists**; nothing was changed. Tell the user *"You already have a profile named `<profile>` — pick a different name for this database,"* go back to **0a.3** to rename (then re-write the template in 0a.4 under the new name), and **stop**. Never overwrite or duplicate an existing profile.
- `PLACEHOLDERS_REMAIN <fields>` → the template still holds template values; tell the user which fields to fill and **stop** (never introspect against a template).
- `NOTHING` → no `credentials.example` to promote (already promoted, or never written) — fall back to the preflight decision.

(`$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT` is the plugin root; `promote_credentials.py` is stdlib-only and needs no special interpreter.)

**Run `setup_pgauth.py --all`** before the first native-CLI query (writes `.pgpass` / `.mysql.cnf` so passwords never hit the command line). Idempotent. Then continue to Phase 1.

## Phase 0s: Sample-database bootstrap (no connection)

**Runs only when the user chose `Try a sample database` in 0a.2** (or said "I don't have a database" / "try the sample" / ran `agami-connect sample`). This **replaces Phases 0a, 1, and 2** with a short deterministic wire-up — no credential template, no hand-off turn, no live introspection on the fast path. The committed sample dataset + its prebuilt model live at **`$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/samples/store/`** (`seed.sql`, `build_sample.py`, `model/`). Profile is always **`agami-example`**.

If `<artifacts_dir>/agami-example/org.yaml` already exists, the sample is already set up → skip to the demo query (step 7), or treat `reintrospect` as the 6B rebuild.

**Todo seed (use these instead of the 9-phase introspect seed).** The **copy** path (6A) skips introspect/enrich/seed entirely (it copies a pre-built model); the **rebuild** path (6B) *does* run introspect → enrich → seed, but with the sample carve-outs spelled out in 6B (no prune/org/doc prompts). Keep labels plain and user-facing — describe the action, not how good it is; no "wow"/"magic"/sales framing:

```
1. Set up the sample database
2. Build the local database file
3. Configure the sample profile
4. Load the semantic model
5. Run a first query
```

1. **Set up `local/`** (same as 0a.1): `mkdir -p "<artifacts_dir>/local" && chmod 700 "<artifacts_dir>/local"`. Ensure `<artifacts_dir>/.gitignore` ignores `local/`. Resolve `<artifacts_dir>` per Phase 0 (first run: ask via 0a.6, default `~/agami-artifacts`).
2. **Resolve `$PY` + the agami-core package** (trimmed 0a.5/0a.5b): SQLite needs **no DB driver** (stdlib), so only ensure the **agami-core** package is importable in `$PY` — confirm via AskUserQuestion, then `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" install` (the one, one-time install via the `sm` launcher; brings pydantic/sqlglot/pyyaml and works with no `packages/` dir). Detect the `sqlite3` CLI with `which sqlite3` → `tier = cli` if present else `python`.
3. **Build the `.db`** into the gitignored `local/` (it's regenerable machine state, not committed):
   ```bash
   "$PY" "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/samples/store/build_sample.py" --out "<artifacts_dir>/local/samples/store.db"
   ```
   Uses the `sqlite3` CLI if present, else the stdlib builder. ~seconds; prints the size.
4. **Write the `[agami-example]` credential by reusing the deterministic promoter** — don't hand-roll the INI. Write a `credentials.example` whose `[agami-example]` section has the **resolved absolute** path from step 3, then promote it:
   ```ini
   [agami-example]
   type = sqlite
   path = <resolved abs path to local/samples/store.db>
   ```
   ```bash
   python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/promote_credentials.py"
   ```
   `SECURED`/`APPENDED` → chmod 600, collision-safe. (No placeholders → never trips `PLACEHOLDERS_REMAIN`.)
5. **Write `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config`** (same shape as 0a.7): `active_profile: agami-example`, `artifacts_dir`, `tool_paths.python3 = $PY` (+ `sqlite3` if found), `tier`. `chmod 600`.
6. **Fork — copy the ready-made model, or rebuild it live? (AskUserQuestion).** Ask once, before touching `<artifacts_dir>/agami-example/`:
   > The sample comes with a ready-made semantic model. Want to query it right away, or watch agami build that model from the data first?

   | option | branch |
   |---|---|
   | `Just let me query it (Recommended)` | **6A — copy** |
   | `Build the model from scratch so I can see it work` | **6B — rebuild live (~5–10 min)** |

   - **6A (copy, < 1 min):** `mkdir -p "<artifacts_dir>/agami-example"` then `cp -R "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/samples/store/model/." "<artifacts_dir>/agami-example/"`. **Validate it loads here**: `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" validate "<artifacts_dir>/agami-example"`. If it fails, surface the errors and stop — never leave a half-wired profile. Then **stamp a model_version** (a *copy* doesn't go through introspect/curate, so nothing auto-stamps it): `bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" snapshot "<artifacts_dir>/agami-example"` — best-effort, so the answer receipt shows a version rather than `null`. (We stamp at copy time instead of committing a static `.snapshots/` so it always matches the model's actual content; 6B gets one automatically from introspect.)
   - **6B (rebuild live — "watch it build"):** ignore the committed `model/` and run the **normal Phases 1→2** against the `agami-example` profile (`--db-type sqlite`) — the same introspect → enrich → seed pipeline a real onboarding uses, just pointed at the sample SQLite file. It takes a few minutes (the non-default option). **Don't mention tokens, cost, or billing** — surface time (~5–10 min), not scary money words.
     - **Sample carve-outs — the dataset is small + curated, so DON'T prompt (build silently over ALL tables):** skip the [Phase 1.6](#16--discover--prune-the-table-list-cheap-first-pass) **prune** page, skip the **org-description** prompt (Phase 2f / 0a), and skip the **doc/metrics intake** (Phase 1's "do you have a data dictionary / dbt repo?"). These prompts exist for a real unknown DB; for the sample they're noise. Introspect + enrich every sample table without asking.
     - **When the model validates, OPEN THE MODEL-EXPLORER so the user sees what was built** — render it in **browse mode** (`render_model_explorer.py` for `<artifacts_dir>/agami-example`, i.e. `/agami-model` browse — **not** the `/agami-model preseed` sign-off gate that ends the turn elsewhere in this skill). This is the whole point of "watch it build"; a prose-only wrap would defeat it. Render it *together with* step 7's short dataset description + starter questions (so don't cede the turn), so the user can both look at the model and start asking. (Do **not** render the NL→SQL examples-validation page — lower-value for the curated sample.)

   **6A** → **step 7** (describe + stop). **6B** → step 7's description + starter questions **and** open `/agami-model`. Both end with a validated `<artifacts_dir>/agami-example/` model.
7. **Wrap up — describe the dataset, offer questions, then STOP. Do NOT auto-run a query.** This is the entire closing for the sample path: **skip the rest of Phases 3–8** (no introspect summary, no "re-introspect `<profile>`" / "when you want the real thing" framing — that pushes the user off the sample they just picked and can surface another profile's name). The user asked to *query* the sample, not watch a scripted demo — so hand them the keys, don't drive. **(Exception: 6B already opened `/agami-model` — that's the one review surface the "watch it build" path keeps; see 6B. The 6A copy path opens nothing.)**
   - **Short description (2–3 lines, plain):** what the dataset is, drawn from `<artifacts_dir>/agami-example/ORGANIZATION.md` — Acme Store, a retailer with one-time **commerce** (customers, products by category, orders, line items, payments, refunds) and recurring **subscriptions** (plans, subscriptions, invoices). ~500 customers, ~4,000 orders over ~2 years. State it; don't sell it.
   - **A numbered list of ~6 starter questions — and DO NOT answer any of them.** The user picks. **Include at least two genuinely complex multi-table joins** so they see agami handle real joins, not just single-table counts (a flat list of trivial questions undersells it). A good set:
     ```
     1. What's our revenue by product category?                          (line items → products → categories)
     2. Which product categories drive the most revenue in each sales channel?  (line items → products → categories + orders)
     3. Who are the top 5 customers by total spend?                      (customers → orders)
     4. Show the monthly revenue trend over the last 12 months.
     5. How many customers have both an order and a subscription?        (commerce ↔ subscriptions)
     6. How many active subscriptions do we have, and what's MRR?
     ```
     (Questions 1 and 2 are the multi-table joins. All six are backed by EXPLAIN-validated seed examples in the shipped model, so they answer reliably.)
   - Then **stop and wait.** Nothing about agami-serve / agami-model / corrections yet — let them experience one real query in Claude Code first. When the user picks a number or asks anything, hand to [agami-query](../agami-query/SKILL.md) — it answers AND runs its own first-query flow (the one-time GitHub-star ask + `/agami-serve` pointer, gated by `local/.optins`). **Do NOT pre-narrate fan/chasm traps or "what agami caught."** If their question hits a trap (questions 1–3 can), agami-query surfaces it in the answer's receipt — let it happen on a real question instead of scripting it.
8. **The "where to go deeper" footer (corrections / `/agami-model` / `/agami-serve`) fires from agami-query, not here.** When the user asks their first sample question, agami-query owns the turn — so its Phase 4f surfaces a one-time orientation footer for the `agami-example` profile (see [agami-query SKILL.md → Phase 4f](../agami-query/SKILL.md)). Don't try to print it from Phase 0s — a footer placed here never executes once agami-query has taken over. Phase 0s ends at step 7 (describe + questions + stop).

---

## Phase 1: Introspect → semantic model

### 1.0 — Set expectations before kicking off

Introspection can take a while against cloud DBs. Tell the user **before** the first probe. Honest estimates — **don't lowball** (a user told "5 min" who waits 4 thinks "almost there"; one told "1 min" thinks "stuck").

| db_type | Typical | Why |
|---|---|---|
| sqlite / duckdb | < 5s | local file |
| postgres / mysql (local) | 5–15s | fast catalog |
| postgres / mysql (cloud) | 15–60s | network RTT per query + FK overlap checks |
| **redshift / databricks / trino** | **~30s for ≤20 tables; 10–30+ min for 50+** | unenforced FKs → the relationship phase confirms joins by value-overlap, one scan per candidate over the network, and big fact tables dominate. **Scale your estimate with table count and warn explicitly.** |
| **snowflake** | **5–15 min** | cold-warehouse spin-up dominates; per-table queries, sample scans, EXPLAIN validation. A 100-table account measured ~12 min. |
| sqlserver / oracle | 30s–5 min | network + per-table catalog |

**Set a HONEST estimate — understating it is what makes a working run read as "stuck."** For a large schema (50+ tables) on Redshift/Databricks/Trino, say so up front: e.g. *"This is ~50 tables on Redshift — the relationship phase confirms joins by value-overlap, so expect **10–30 minutes**. I'll stream progress and report when it lands."* Then **stream the heartbeat** (background + tail, per 1.7) so the user sees `columns+grain 30/52` and `relationships: declared FK 80/187` rather than silence. For `reintrospect`, prepend "Re-introspecting (about as long as initial setup)."

### 1.1 — Existing-model check

If `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/org.yaml` exists and `$ARGUMENTS != reintrospect`: the profile is already onboarded. Offer (AskUserQuestion, no `(Recommended)` — these are equal-weight choices), capped at 4:
- **Re-introspect `<profile>`** — refresh the structure from the live DB (new/changed tables, columns, FKs) while preserving descriptions, entities, metrics, caveats, and sign-offs (the `reintrospect` path).
- **Open model explorer** — browse + curate the existing model and review/sign off the trust layer (`/agami-model`).
- **Onboard another database** — set up a **different** database (a different connection) under a **new** profile, leaving `<profile>` untouched. On this choice, **start a fresh onboarding for a new profile**: jump to the profile-naming step (Phase 0a's naming question) → have the user name the new profile (must differ from `<profile>` and any existing `[section]` in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials`) and pick its DB type → write that profile's `credentials.example` → run the full flow for it. Never reuse or overwrite the current profile's credentials or model.
- **Try the sample database** — explore agami's bundled **`agami-example`** sample (retail + subscriptions, no connection needed), leaving `<profile>` untouched. Routes to [Phase 0s](#phase-0s-sample-database-bootstrap-no-connection). This MUST be a real selectable option here (not a prose aside) — a returning user with an onboarded profile has no other visible path to the sample, since plain `/agami-connect` resolves their active profile and lands on this menu.

(Cancel isn't a listed option — the modal's Esc / "Other" covers "do nothing"; the four real choices are the actions above. Keep the list at exactly these four.)

**Same DB, another *schema*? That's the Re-introspect path, not "Onboard another database."** If the user wants to add a schema that lives in the **same database** they already onboarded (e.g. they did `public`, now they want `billing` too), choose **Re-introspect** and **expand the schema selection** in Phase 1.3 to include both the old and the new schemas. The engine scans them together in one pass, so any relationship between the original and the new schema is detected as a first-class **cross-schema** join (Case 1) and surfaced for review. Picking "Onboard another database" instead would split the two schemas into separate models and demote any link between them to manual cross-profile glue (Phase 2b federation) — wrong for one DB. If you're unsure which the user means, ask: *"Is `billing` in the same database connection as `<profile>`, or a different server/database?"* — same connection → Re-introspect + expand schemas; different → new profile.

The engine **auto-backs-up any legacy (v1) model** (`index.yaml` + per-schema `_schema.yaml`) it finds at the profile root into `.legacy_backup/` before writing — so a first run over an old profile is safe and reversible; surface a one-liner when that happens.

### 1.2 — Scope: schemas, and the no-catalog case

Run `cli areas`/probe is not needed yet — schema discovery happens inside the engine. But **decide scope first**:

- **Catalog reachable (common):** after the engine lists schemas, it introspects all of them. If the DB has many schemas (Snowflake with 50+), narrow first — ask the user which schemas matter (multi-select), then pass them as the engine's table allowlist scope. Pre-check `public` (Postgres) / `PUBLIC` (Snowflake) / the credentials' `database` (MySQL).
  - **Supabase is handled automatically** — the engine detects it by signature and drops its system schemas (`auth`, `storage`, `vault`, `realtime`, `extensions`, …) so only the user's app schemas (e.g. `public`) are modeled (it surfaces a note saying which it skipped). **Don't hand-build a `--tables` allowlist for Supabase** to dodge the system tables — that's already done, and a manual allowlist is fragile (shell word-splitting, missed tables). Only allowlist when the user genuinely wants a subset of their *own* tables.
- **Catalog denied (locked-down role):** if a quick probe shows the catalog isn't readable, the engine **cannot enumerate tables** — ask the user for the table list:
  > Your role can read the data but not the catalog, so I can't list tables automatically. Paste the tables to model (e.g. `sales.orders, sales.customers`) — I'll describe each from the data itself.

  Pass these to the engine via `--tables schema.table …`. Everything the engine then infers (types, grain, FKs) lands `unreviewed` for sign-off.

### 1.3 — Schema picker (multi-select)

For non-SQLite/DuckDB with multiple schemas, **AskUserQuestion** multi-select: "Which schemas should I introspect?" One option per schema + `All schemas` + `Just <default> for now`. Record `selected_schemas`; the engine scopes to these.

**On re-introspect / an existing model — pre-check the schemas already modeled, and make "add" vs "replace" explicit.** Read the schemas already in `<profile>`'s model (the distinct `schema` of its existing tables) and **pre-check those** in the picker, labelled `<schema> (already in your model)`. Tell the user plainly:

> The engine re-scans exactly the schemas you check here and rebuilds the structure from them. To **add** a schema, leave the existing ones checked and tick the new one — relationships between them get found in the same pass. **Unchecking a schema removes its tables from the model** (its hand-edits are preserved only if you keep it checked).

This is the union-rescan that makes Case 2 work: adding `billing` to a model that already has `public` must scan `public` ∪ `billing` together — scanning only `billing` would build the new schema's internal joins but **miss every join back to `public`** (a cross-schema edge needs both endpoints in one introspection pass). Never silently re-scan just the delta.

**Reconcile what you'll scan vs what's actually there — NEVER silently shrink the scope.** When the user picks `All schemas` (or you narrow the set yourself), do NOT quietly hand the engine a smaller list. Count what the catalog holds (schemas + tables) and **state plainly what you're INCLUDING and what you're LEAVING OUT, with a reason for each exclusion**, then confirm. Three kinds get excluded and each must be named, not dropped silently:
- **System/internal schemas** — `pg_auto_copy`, `pg_*`, `information_schema`, Supabase `auth`/`storage`/… (the engine already drops these; still *report* them).
- **A schema that looks like a DIFFERENT dataset** — e.g. a `public` full of Salesforce objects (`accounts`, `opportunities`, `leads`, `contacts`, `pricebooks`) sitting next to ServiceNow module schemas. Don't fold a foreign domain into this model; **name it and offer it as its own profile**.
- **Tables you allowlist away** — any explicit `--tables`/`--tables-file` subset.

Example to say BEFORE introspecting: *"Found 70 tables across 18 schemas. I'll model the **52** in the 16 ServiceNow module schemas. **Excluding:** `public` (17 — `accounts`/`opportunities`/`leads`… looks like a separate Salesforce dataset; onboard it as its own profile if you want it) and `pg_auto_copy` (1 — Redshift system). Good?"* A user who said "all" must SEE the delta up front — never discover later that 19 tables never made it in. This is mandatory whenever discovered-count ≠ scanned-count.

### 1.4 — Organization context (MANDATORY — ALWAYS ASK)

This runs on **every** invocation. The user's yes/skip is theirs; the skill never decides for them. "don't ask clarifying questions" does NOT cancel this — it's required state-gathering, not a clarifying question. **Only conditional skip:** `ORGANIZATION.md` exists and has been edited beyond the template.

**AskUserQuestion:**
> Want to give me a one-paragraph description of what this database is about? It improves NL→SQL accuracy a lot. Examples: what the company/product is, what "MRR" or "active user" means in your terms.

`Yes — I'll type it now (Other field)` → write their words to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/ORGANIZATION.md` under `# About this database`. **Their narrative ONLY** — do NOT append model facts (subject areas, metrics, glossary). Those are *derived from the model at read time* (the query path assembles them via `cli org-context`), so they never get baked into the editable prose file where a human could clobber them. `Skip — I'll auto-fill it from my data (Recommended)` → leave ORGANIZATION.md absent for now; Phase 2f writes a short human-narrative starter. `chmod 600` whatever you write. See [`shared/organization-context-format.md`](../../shared/organization-context-format.md).

### 1.5 — Existing data model / semantic layer (MANDATORY — ALWAYS ASK)

Independent of 1.4 (paragraph ≠ doc). Same "required state-gathering" rule. Several very different sources qualify, so ask once and branch on the answer. **AskUserQuestion** (multi-select; the repo path is the high-value one — it encodes metrics + joins, not just structure):

> Got an existing data model or metrics list I can read? A few kinds help:
> • **A doc** — ERD, data dictionary, schema diagram (PDF, PNG/JPG, text, markdown, CSV).
> • **A metrics / KPI list** — a spreadsheet, CSV, or doc of your metrics and how each is defined (e.g. "Approval rate = approved ÷ applications"). I'll turn each into a reusable metric so answers match your numbers.
> • **A semantic-layer / transform repo** — LookML, dbt, Cube, MetricFlow. These define your metrics, dimensions, and joins explicitly, which is gold for NL→SQL accuracy. They're usually git-backed — just point me at the folder.
> • **A published product schema** — if this DB is a well-known product (ServiceNow, Salesforce, Jira, NetSuite, SAP, HubSpot, Workday…), I can look up its official table/column reference online so the standard fields get correct descriptions automatically.

Options: `Doc / metrics file — I'll attach it` / `Semantic-layer repo — I'll give a path` / `Published product schema — look it up` / `Skip — nothing to share`. (Multi-select — combine as needed.)

**If a doc:** `Read` the path (handles PDF/image/md/text/CSV natively; trim huge files to first 20 pages / 50 rows). `.xlsx`/`.docx` → ask for PDF, proceed without if not.

**If a published product schema (or the user names one — "use the ServiceNow data model online"):** the user wants the standard fields grounded in the authoritative reference, not your training memory.

1. **Prefer the in-DB metadata.** Most metadata-driven platforms carry their own dictionary *in the database* (ServiceNow `sys_dictionary`/`sys_choice`, SAP `DD03L`, …). That's authoritative AND machine-readable — far better than scraping docs. So the real answer here is usually **Phase 2a.0's `sm enrich-metadata`**, not a web fetch. Note that intent now; it runs during enrichment.
2. **Web reference as fallback / supplement.** When there's no in-DB dictionary, **`WebSearch`/`WebFetch`** the official developer/data-dictionary docs for the named product + the tables you discovered in 1.6. If you chose this path, the fetch is **mandatory, not optional** — do it once, upfront, and stash into `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT` (never written to disk). Note that vendor doc portals are often **JS-rendered and return only nav skeletons** (ServiceNow's does); when a fetch comes back empty, fall back to WebSearch result snippets / community pages and say so — don't silently substitute training knowledge.
3. **Propagate it.** If you fan enrichment out to subagents, **every subagent prompt MUST include `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT`** with the instruction: *describe standard fields from this reference; if a field isn't in the reference or the data, mark it `ai_unknown` — do NOT fill it from general product knowledge.* (This is the hole that let subagents drift to "from ServiceNow domain knowledge.")

Stay anchored to the tables you actually introspected; don't invent fields the live DB doesn't have.

**If a semantic-layer repo:** ask for the directory (a local clone / monorepo path — no upload needed since it's git-backed). Glob the **definition** files and `Read` them up to a budget (~30 files / ~250 KB total; if larger, prefer metric/model definitions and tell the user what you sampled). **Skip compiled SQL and data files** — you want the declared metrics/joins, not the warehouse output:
> | Layer | Read these | Carries |
> |---|---|---|
> | **LookML** | `*.view.lkml`, `*.explore.lkml`, `*.model.lkml` | dimensions, **measures** (→ metrics), **joins** (→ relationships), `sql_table_name` |
> | **dbt** | `models/**/*.yml` (esp. `schema.yml`), `semantic_models/**`, `metrics/**`, `dbt_project.yml` | column descriptions, `relationships` tests (→ FKs), MetricFlow metrics/measures |
> | **Cube** | `model/**/*.{yml,js}` (or `schema/**`) | `measures`, `dimensions`, `joins` |

Stash everything gathered (doc text + repo definitions) as `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT` for enrichment — give entities/metrics/relationships found here **`confidence: inferred`** (a declared metric is a strong signal but still wants a human sign-off; FK-derived joins stay as the engine set them). **Never written to disk** — lives only in the enrichment prompt, then discarded. `Skip` → proceed.

### 1.6 — Discover & prune the table list (cheap first pass)

**Before the full, expensive introspection, show the user every table + its columns so they can drop what they don't need** — staging/backup/scratch tables, dated partition snapshots, irrelevant columns. The full grain/FK/description work then runs on **only the kept tables**, which on a big DB (hundreds of staging/snapshot tables) is the difference between minutes and hours.

**Run the discover pass** — it lists tables + columns only (no grain, FK, or row-count probes, so it's fast even over a tunnel):

```bash
ts=$(date -u +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" discover \
  --profile <profile> --db-type <db_type> \
  --artifacts "<artifacts_dir>" \
  --out "<artifacts_dir>/local/prune/<profile>/$ts.html" \
  [--schemas <selected_schemas…>]   # the 1.3 pick, if you narrowed schemas
```

It writes the inventory to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/.introspect/inventory.json`, renders a standalone **prune page**, and prints JSON with `table_count` + `prune_html`. (This page is a deliberately minimal, separate artifact — *not* the model explorer — so there's no description/metric/review machinery, just tables + columns + checkboxes.)

**Open the page, hand off, and END THE TURN** — same pattern as the credentials hand-off; pruning is interactive:
- Auto-open the printed `prune_html` path.
- Tell the user: *"I listed all `<N>` tables and their columns. Uncheck any you don't need (staging, backups, snapshots); you can also expand a table and drop irrelevant columns. Then click **Generate for Claude** and paste the block back here."*
- **End the turn. Do NOT introspect yet.**

**On re-entry — the user pastes an `AGAMI PRUNE …` block.** Don't hand-parse it — pipe it to the parser, which writes a **shell-safe** tables file (sidestepping the zsh word-split that collapses an unquoted list into one garbage table):
```bash
parse_prune_block.py --block-file <pasted> --tables-out /tmp/agami-keep.txt
```
It prints `{data: {tables_kept, tables_file, excluded_columns, kept_everything}, anomalies}`. Pass `--tables-file "$tables_file"` and `--exclude-columns <excluded_columns…>` to 1.7. **`kept_everything: true`** → run 1.7 with neither flag. Surface `anomalies` (a `bad_table_line`, a `keep_count_mismatch`) rather than silently dropping a line.

If the user instead asks to skip pruning ("just introspect everything"), proceed to 1.7 unscoped.

### 1.7 — Run the introspection engine (on the kept tables)

This is the deterministic core — it replaces hand-authoring tables/columns/FK SQL/confidence formulas. From `plugins/agami/scripts/`:

```bash
# write the kept allowlist to a file first (zsh-safe — no word-splitting to get wrong)
printf '%s\n' incident problem change_request sys_user ... > /tmp/agami-keep.txt
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" introspect \
  --profile <profile> --db-type <db_type> \
  --artifacts "<artifacts_dir>" \
  [--tables-file /tmp/agami-keep.txt] \
  [--exclude-columns <schema.table.column list from 1.6>]
```

`--tables-file` is the prune step's **kept set** (it also covers the no-catalog/probe-only case from 1.2). `--exclude-columns` marks the dropped columns excluded during the build — one validated write, no follow-up curate call. Omit both only when the user kept everything or skipped pruning. (If a table name is bogus / can't be described, the engine now drops it with a note and — if *nothing* describes — errors clearly instead of writing a partial model.)

**On a large schema (50+ tables) over a tunnel this takes minutes and the command prints nothing until it returns — which reads as hung.** Two ways to keep it legible, in order of preference:

1. **Batched build (preferred for 30+ tables) — `--append`.** Split the kept allowlist into batches of ~10–15 tables and introspect **one batch per call**, each a quick *foreground* command that returns in tens of seconds. Every call MERGES into the existing model (prior tables are loaded from disk, never re-queried), so you end with the full union — and you report `batch 3/5 (+12 tables)` between calls, natural progress with **no background monitor to babysit**:
   ```bash
   split -l 12 /tmp/agami-keep.txt /tmp/agami-batch-      # batch files
   for b in /tmp/agami-batch-*; do
     bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" introspect --profile <p> --db-type <t> \
       --artifacts "<artifacts_dir>" --tables-file "$b" --append
   done
   ```
   (`--append` on the first batch just creates the model — there's nothing to merge yet. The relationship pass runs each batch across the union, deduped, so the final batch yields the complete join graph.)
2. **Single background call + tail.** If you'd rather one call: run it **in the background** (Bash `run_in_background: true`) and `tail` its progress log every ~15–20s, surfacing the latest line. The engine writes a flushed, **throttled** (~every 10%) per-phase log to `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/.introspect/progress.log` (override with `--progress`): `discovered 52 tables …`, `columns+grain 30/52`, `relationships: declared FK 80/187`, `done`.

(For a small DB introspect returns in seconds — no batching or backgrounding needed.)

It builds + **validates** + writes the model at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`: storage connection, **proposed subject areas**, per-table columns + types (catalog or value-inferred), PK→`grain`, FK→`relationships` with **inferred cardinality** (`many_to_one`/`one_to_many`/`one_to_one`), `column_groups` on deep tables (≥30 cols), `sensitive` flags on PII, cross-area edges, and a report. Relationships from **unenforced-FK** dialects (Redshift/Databricks/Trino) and everything from probe mode are confirmed-by-overlap or `unreviewed`. The report prints the **capability mode per step** (catalog vs probe) — surface that to the user so they know what was read vs inferred.

The validator gates the write — **if it fails, the model is not persisted.** Surface the errors verbatim and stop (this should be rare; the engine emits valid models).

Surface: `✓ Introspected <N> tables across <A> subject area(s) (<catalog|probe> mode); <R> relationships, <D> deep tables, <S> sensitive columns flagged.`

**Backstop reconciliation — if `<N>` is fewer than the catalog held, say what's NOT in the model and why** (the 1.3 guard should have covered this up front; repeat it here so it can't slip). E.g. *"Modeled 52 of 70 tables — left out `public` (17, separate Salesforce dataset) and `pg_auto_copy` (1, system). Say the word if you want any of them."* A user who picked "all" should never have to diff the catalog themselves to notice a schema is missing.

---

## Phase 2: Enrich (the LLM layer — validated into the model)

The engine gives structure; you add meaning. Load the model with `cli bundle <root> --area <area>` (or read the YAMLs). After each enrichment pass, **re-validate** (`cli validate <root>`) and never persist a model that fails. `<root>` = `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/`.

> **HARD RULE — decisions to you, plumbing to the engine. NEVER write a generator script** (`build_ops.py`, `build_desc.py`, `enrich_*.py`, a one-off that loops to build curate ops). It's the recurring failure mode and it's banned. When you have many edits, emit them as data and let a tested command apply them: `sm describe-file` (TSV of descriptions), `sm enrich-metadata` (in-DB metadata), `sm set-units`, `sm suggest-metrics`, or `sm curate --ops-file <json>`. You decide *what* (currency, which metrics, a column's meaning); the engine does the *applying*.

### 2a.0 — Deterministic metadata FIRST (run before any hand-enrichment)

**Many databases describe themselves.** Metadata-driven platforms ship their own data dictionary + value-label tables (ServiceNow `sys_dictionary` + `sys_choice`, SAP `DD03L`, Salesforce metadata…), and plenty of ordinary schemas have code→label lookup/dimension tables. When that metadata is present it is **authoritative** — strictly better than LLM guessing or fetching JS-walled vendor docs. Always try it first:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" enrich-metadata "$ROOT" --profile <profile> --db-type <db_type>
```

It auto-detects a preset (e.g. `servicenow`) or takes `--preset`, reads the dictionary/lookup tables, and applies — in validated curate batches — **column descriptions** (stamped `description_source: metadata`, authoritative), **`choice_field` labels**, and **reference/FK relationships** (the `caller_id → sys_user` edges that `<x>_id` name-matching can't find). On ServiceNow this alone closes most of the column-coverage, enum-decode, and join-graph gaps deterministically. It prints what it enriched. **Then** hand-enrich only what it didn't cover (2a–2c below). `--skip-references` if you want descriptions/choices only.

### 2a — Descriptions (describe coded columns; leave only self-evident ones empty)

For each table fetch up to 5 sample rows for evidence (`SELECT * FROM <t> LIMIT 5`; Snowflake `SAMPLE` for >10M rows). **Samples are never written to disk** — context only, then discarded. Also capture MIN/MAX of each time column → record under the table's `performance_hints` so Phase 5 anchors "last 30 days" to the data's real MAX, not `NOW()`.

Build a per-schema prompt with `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT` first (dominant prior), then `ORGANIZATION.md`, then tables/columns/sample rows. **Always** emit a 1-line table `description`. For **columns**, classify each into one of three — don't default everything to empty:

| Kind | Examples | What to write |
|---|---|---|
| **Self-evident** | `id`, `created_at`, `email`, `name`, `gender`, `city` | `""` — the name + type already says it; a description would just restate it. |
| **Informative** | `revenue_usd`, `status`, `margin_pct`, `utilization_pct` | one line **iff** samples/doc support a fact the name doesn't (enum values, unit, derivation, a caveat). Else `""`. |
| **Coded / opaque-but-systematic** | `EL_REVENUE_30D`, `WEST_ORDERS_12M`, `<TIER_A_6M>`, `XX_<metric>` families | **always describe** — unreadable without the legend (see below). |

**Coded-schema detection + legend expansion — the case that used to get wrongly left empty.** Feature stores, wide denormalized marts, and coded analytic extracts encode meaning in column *names* via a small recurring token vocabulary: a category prefix (e.g. `EL/HM/AP…`), a window suffix (`_30D`, `_6M`, `_12M`), a bucket (`_0_30`, `_TIER_A`), a threshold (`_LT_1K`, `_LT_10K`), a metric stem (`_REVENUE`, `_QTY`, `_RECENCY`). When the same tokens recur across many columns:

1. **Decode the token legend once** — grounded in column samples + `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT` + `ORGANIZATION.md`. For any token whose meaning isn't evident, **ask the user in one batched question** rather than guessing (this is the same decode 2b needs; do it once and share it).
2. **Expand the legend into one description per coded column — deterministically, NOT as N separate LLM guesses.** Write a small in-skill decoder (a token→phrase map + a per-table parse of `(prefix, metric, window, threshold)`) and compose each description from it, then emit them through the same `sm curate` batch. This is exact, internally consistent, and costs zero per-column LLM tokens. e.g. `EL_REVENUE_30D` → "Total revenue from the Electronics category over the last 30 days"; `WEST_ORDERS_12M` → "Number of orders in the West region over the last 12 months"; `EL_ORDERS_LT_1K_90D` → "Number of Electronics orders under 1,000 placed in the last 90 days." (Use the user's actual token vocabulary + domain, not these placeholders.)
3. The same decoded legend also lands in the **structured glossary** `key_terminology` (term → definition) — abbreviations and codes a reader needs (an acronym → its expansion; a status/type code → its meaning). **Decode once, write both** — the per-column descriptions (what shows in the explorer + feeds the SQL generator's column context) AND the glossary. Write it with the packaged command (a JSON object `{term: definition, …}`); it merges over any existing terms, validates, and commits:
   ```bash
   bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" set-terminology "$ROOT" --file /tmp/agami-terminology.json
   ```
   The glossary is rendered into `ORGANIZATION.md`'s `## Key terminology` by `org-draft` (which **also** auto-seeds enum legends from `choice_field` columns) — so it survives a regeneration and is never a bare placeholder. **Do NOT skip this on a code-dense schema** (abbreviations, master-coded values): an empty Key terminology on a DB full of codes is a real miss.

Don't skip a coded column because "the legend covers it" — the legend lives in a *different file*; the per-column description is what the explorer shows and what NL→SQL reads. A wide coded table (hundreds of columns) should finish at ~100% column coverage, not ~3%.

**Value-enum decode — FILL `choice_field` for coded-VALUE columns (the highest-leverage structured win).** Distinct from the coded-*name* legend above: this is a column whose stored VALUES are codes — a `severity` of 1/2/3, a `state` of 1/2/3/6/7, a `priority` of 1–5, a short status/type code. **Introspection now seeds a `choice_field` skeleton** — the full map of distinct sampled codes with blank labels (e.g. `{"1":"","2":"","3":""}`, not a single placeholder) — on every low-cardinality coded column, so the keys already exist and you only fill the labels. **Your job is to fill the labels** — from samples + `$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT`, or a lookup/choice table when the DB has one (e.g. ServiceNow `sys_choice`: `SELECT value, label FROM sys_choice WHERE name='<table>' AND element='<column>'` — read it once and apply, don't hand-guess). Write it as a **structured `choice_field` edit op**, not just prose:
```json
{"op":"edit","kind":"table","area":"<area>","name":"<table>","column":"severity","field":"choice_field","value":{"1":"High","2":"Medium","3":"Low"}}
```
Why structured beats prose: the SQL generator translates "high severity" → `severity = 1` and **labels result rows** from the map deterministically — a decode buried in the description can't be applied programmatically. **Fill the skeleton on every coded-value column** in the same `sm curate` batch as the descriptions; leave a label blank only when no sample/doc/lookup reveals it. (The filled map also auto-seeds the glossary via `org-draft`.) Self-labeling value sets (a `region` of North/South/East/West) can keep `choice_field` as the values themselves or be cleared — they need no translation.

**Write descriptions with `sm curate` edit ops — never hand-edit the table YAML, and never write a throwaway generator script to build the ops.** Build one ops array and run it once; it validates the whole model + commits + reverts on failure. **The op does NOT need `area`** — curate resolves which area owns a table/column by name, so you do **not** maintain a `table → area` map (that map is exactly what used to push the LLM into writing an `enrich_gen.py`; it's gone). Shapes:
- table: `{op:edit, kind:table, name:"<table>", field:"description", value:"<text>", source:"ai"}`
- column: same + `column:"<col>"`

Pass `area` **only** to disambiguate a bare name that exists in two schemas (curate skips an ambiguous op with a clear "pass an explicit area" reason rather than editing the wrong one). **Always include `"source":"ai"` on every generated description** — this stamps `description_source: ai_unvalidated` so the description earns trust through use (agami-query surfaces it in the answer receipt for confirmation the first time a query actually uses that column, instead of forcing an upfront review of hundreds of descriptions). **Skip any column that already has a description** (so a partial hand-edit or a reintrospect merge is never clobbered):
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate "$ROOT" --ops-file /tmp/agami-descriptions.json
```

| Column | Bad (reject) | Good (keep) | Empty (preferred) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id`, `created_at`, `email`, `name` | "Primary key" / "When created" / "Email" | (always empty — self-evident) | `""` |
| `customer_id` | "The customer ID" | "FK to customers.id; 1:N with orders" | `""` if nothing to add |
| `status` | "A status code" | "lifecycle: pending → shipped → cancelled" (only if enum known) | `""` |
| `EL_AOV_90D` (coded) | "AOV value" | "Average order value for the Electronics category over the last 90 days" (from the decoded legend) | — **don't leave empty** |
| `v_1`, `tmp_col`, `x` | "A value" | (leave empty — opaque, no decodable structure) | `""` |

**What NOT to invent:** meanings for truly opaque single columns (`v_1`, `tmp_col`, `xyz`) that have no decodable token structure and no sample signal. Business semantics not present in the samples/doc. Name translations on self-evident columns (`amt`→"amount"). Write the decodable legend; don't fabricate the rest.

**For an opaque column you genuinely can't read, say so — don't leave it silently blank.** There are two kinds of empty description, and they must be distinguished:
- **Self-evident** (`id`, `created_at`, `email`, a clear `name`) → leave the description empty AND leave `description_source` unset (`null`). The name already says it; nothing to flag.
- **Opaque / unknown** (`xyz`, `v_1`, `tmp_col`, a code whose meaning no sample or doc reveals) → leave the description empty BUT set **`description_source: "ai_unknown"`** via a curate edit op (`{op:edit, kind:table, area, name:<table>, column:<col>, field:"description_source", value:"ai_unknown"}`). This records "agami looked and couldn't tell" — the human knows what `xyz` is, and the explorer + answer receipts surface these so they can fill it in. **Don't guess a meaning to avoid the flag; the flag is the honest answer.** (Do NOT mark a self-evident column `ai_unknown` — that's noise.)

For large schemas (>100 tables) batch 50 at a time; narrate `[batch 2/4] …`. Validate after each schema; on failure, surface errors and continue with the rest, then report which need attention.

**Regroup wide tables into SEMANTIC column groups (do this right after describing their columns).** A deep table (≥30 cols) gets `column_groups` from the engine, but those are a deterministic **name-prefix** split — buckets like `is`, `last`, `latest`, `created`, `bp` — not concepts. They exist only so the explorer can collapse a wide table; they're a fallback, not the goal. Having just described every column, **you** are positioned to cluster them by *meaning* into a handful of named groups that read like mini subject-areas — e.g. `identity`, `location`, `lifecycle_timestamps`, `telemetry`, `swap_details`, `alerts`, `flags`. Keep it to ~5–10 groups; **every column must land in exactly one** (the validator rejects orphans on a deep table). Apply via one curate edit op per wide table:
```json
{"op":"edit","kind":"table","name":"<wide_table>","field":"column_groups",
 "value":{"identity":["..."],"location":["..."],"lifecycle_timestamps":["..."],"telemetry":["..."]}}
```
Send these in the same `sm curate` batch as the descriptions (or a follow-up batch). Only worth doing on genuinely wide tables — narrow tables have no `column_groups` and need none.

**Column-pass completeness gate (MANDATORY — do not skip the column pass).** After enriching, run:
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" coverage "$ROOT"
```
`ok: false` with `unenriched_tables` lists tables that got a **table** description but **no column descriptions at all** — i.e. you enriched the table layer and skipped the columns. That is not done: go back and run the column pass on those tables (describe each meaningful column from sampled values; mark genuinely-opaque ones `ai_unknown`; self-evident `id`/timestamps may stay blank). A wide coded table must finish near 100% described, not 0%. This is also enforced downstream — `seed-examples` **refuses** (`refused: "columns_unenriched"`) while any table is unenriched, so you cannot reach the trust dashboard on naked columns. Don't proceed to 2b until `coverage` returns `ok: true`.

### 2b — Entities (the semantic vocabulary)

Propose `entities[]` per subject area — the names users actually say. For each, fill `name`, `plural`, `other_names` (synonyms), `maps_to` (table+column, one `primary: true`), and — for opaque-identifier columns — a `value_pattern` regex (e.g. a VIN `^[A-Z0-9]{17}$`, a `BP`-prefixed serial) so the runtime can recognize literals. Ground these in column names + samples + the domain doc; don't invent entities the schema doesn't support. Because these are LLM-proposed, write them **`confidence: inferred, review_state: unreviewed`** so they surface in the Phase 4 pre-seed review (seeds reference entity vocabulary).

**Don't stop at id columns — wide / denormalized tables hide dimensions a `maps_to`-on-an-id scan misses.** When a schema is denormalized to one grain (e.g. one row per customer, every table keyed on the same id), an id scan finds exactly one entity and quits — yet real business dimensions are still there, encoded two other ways. Look for both, **discovered from the actual columns + samples, never hardcoded**:
- **Coded column-name prefixes / suffixes.** Many columns sharing a recurring token (`XX_<metric>` repeated for several `XX`, or `<metric>_<period>`) means that token is a dimension (a product line, a region, a time bucket). **Decode it from evidence** — column descriptions, sample values, the domain doc; if a code's meaning isn't evident, **ask in one batched question rather than guessing**. A prefix dimension has no id column, so it isn't a `maps_to` entity — record the decoded legend in `ORGANIZATION.md` `## Key terminology` and fold the expansion into each affected column's description, so NL→SQL can map a phrase to the right prefixed columns.
- **Value-level entities.** A set of sibling string columns whose *values* are real-world instances (institution/lender names, branch names, merchant names, statuses) is an entity even with no id column — create it (`maps_to` the most representative such column; capture distinct sampled values as `other_names`/a `value_pattern` cue) so a user naming a literal value resolves to those columns.

If, after this, a single-grain schema genuinely has one entity, that's the right answer — say so. The point is to *check* the two hidden shapes before concluding "one entity," not to manufacture entities.

**Write them with the packaged command, not by hand** — build a JSON array and run it once (it validates each item, writes `subject_areas/<area>/entities/<slug>.yaml`, validates the whole model, reverts on failure, commits). Never author a throwaway script to loop. The canonical entity YAML shape is [`shared/metric-entity-shape.md`](../../shared/metric-entity-shape.md) — **never read another profile's artifacts to copy it** (see the boundary note under 2c):
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" add "$ROOT" --kind entity --area <area> --file /tmp/agami-entities.json
```

### 2c — Metrics

Metrics come from two sources, handled very differently. **Always prefer declared metrics** — schema-only inference is a shallow guess (it finds `AVG(rating)`, a row count, an `AVG(order_value)`; it misses the domain KPIs a business actually tracks — refund rate, repeat-purchase rate, cohort retention, fulfillment SLA — because those aren't visible in column names).

**(A) Declared metrics — extract in FULL, no cap.** If the user attached a semantic-layer repo or a metrics file in 1.5 (`$DATA_MODEL_DOC_TEXT`), those are the org's *real* definitions — pull **every** one, don't sample to 4:
- **LookML** `measure {}` → metric: `type` + `sql` → `bindings`, `label`/`description` → `calculation`, `label`+`view_label` → `other_names`.
- **dbt** `metrics:` / `semantic_models[].measures` (MetricFlow) → name, `agg`+`expr` → `bindings`, `description`/`label` → `calculation` + `other_names`.
- **Cube** `measures` → `sql`+`type` → `bindings`.
- **Metrics file** (CSV/YAML/markdown KPI dictionary the user uploaded) → one metric per row/entry: name, definition → `calculation`, formula → `bindings`.

Translate the declared SQL/agg to the profile's dialect for `bindings`, set `source_tables`, write **`confidence: inferred, review_state: unreviewed`** (declared = strong signal, still wants a human sign-off on the `/agami-model` Review tab). If there are many (> ~8), **don't** funnel them through a 4-item picker — write them all and tell the user once: *"Added N metrics from your `<LookML/dbt/file>` — review or trim them in /agami-model."* (Offer a single "add all N / let me pick a subset" confirm if you want, but never silently drop declared metrics to fit a cap.)

**(B) Inferred metrics — infer a sensible set for BULK review, don't ask for 4.** Run **`sm suggest-metrics "$ROOT"`**: it infers per-table measures (count of rows, SUM of `additive` columns, AVG of `averageable` columns, flag rates, start→end durations — **gated on the aggregation class** so it's sensible, never "aggregate every number"). It auto-approves the *mechanically trivial* ones (COUNT(*) / SUM(col) / AVG(col) — system-signed, no judgment beyond the column's aggregation class) and leaves the interpretive ones (rates, durations) `proposed`. SUM/AVG metrics **inherit the source column's `unit`** automatically. Rule 1 keeps proposed metrics out of every answer until sign-off, so a large set is safe — the user reviews them **in bulk in the explorer** (Phase 4). This closes the thin-metrics gap (9 vs a mature model's 200+). Reserve **AskUserQuestion** only for a bespoke KPI the user describes in words that the column shapes don't imply.

**Run order matters — describe columns FIRST, then suggest metrics.** `suggest-metrics` **skips columns agami couldn't read** (`description_source: ai_unknown`) — it won't propose a metric on a column it can't explain (the prose would just restate opaque SQL like *"Fraction of alm_asset where active_to is true"*). Its output reports `skipped_opaque: N`. So: settle 2b/2c column descriptions first, run suggest-metrics, and **after the user describes any still-opaque columns** (the explorer's "couldn't read" pile, or a later pass), **re-run `sm suggest-metrics "$ROOT"`** — it's incremental (skips names already written), so the newly-described columns pick up their metrics with no duplicates. This is the re-pass: *describe → suggest → describe more → suggest again.*

**Then HUMANIZE the inferred prose (B-metrics only).** The `calculation` that `suggest-metrics` writes is a *mechanical restatement of the SQL* (`"Total cost across alm_asset"`, `"Fraction of alm_asset where active_to is true"`) — accurate but not a business definition, and it's what agami matches a question against. Once the columns are described, **rewrite each inferred metric's `calculation` into a one-line business definition that conveys WHEN to use it**, grounded in the column/table descriptions + the glossary (NOT product memory). E.g. `"Fraction of alm_asset where active_to is true"` → `"Share of assets still within their active lifecycle window"`. Apply as **one `sm curate` batch** of `{op:edit, kind:metric, area, name, field:"calculation", value:"<prose>"}` ops (decisions to you, plumbing to the engine — never a generator script). Keep auto-approved metrics `approved` and **re-stamp `signed_off_at`** (the definition changed, but the trivial SQL didn't — the user isn't re-vetting math, just better words). Leave declared (A) metrics alone — their prose already came from the source.

**In the SAME batch, fill `other_names` (aliases) where the org has well-known ones** — a metric with empty `other_names` only matches its literal name, so a user asking for "MTTR" / "AHT" / "P1 count" misses a metric named `incident_avg_duration_days`. Add the aliases the org actually uses: from the metrics file / glossary if provided, or the standard abbreviation for that metric *type* (a mean-time-to-resolve duration → `MTTR`; average handle time → `AHT`). Only add genuine aliases — don't pad with restatements of the name. `{op:edit, kind:metric, area, name, field:"other_names", value:["MTTR", …]}`.

For every metric (A or B) fill `name`, prose `calculation` (intent — **required**), per-dialect `bindings` (the SQL), `source_tables`, `other_names`. The canonical YAML shape is [`shared/metric-entity-shape.md`](../../shared/metric-entity-shape.md) (synthetic example). **Write them with the packaged command** — build a JSON array and run it once; never hand-write each YAML and never author a throwaway loop script. It validates each item, writes `subject_areas/<area>/metrics/<slug>.yaml`, validates the whole model, and reverts the batch on failure:
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" add "$ROOT" --kind metric --area <area> --file /tmp/agami-metrics.json
```
> **Never read another profile to learn the shape.** Do not glob or read other profiles' artifacts (e.g. `find <artifacts_dir> -path '*/metrics/*.yaml'`, or reading `<artifacts_dir>/<other-profile>/…`) to "copy the binding shape." That crosses the profile boundary — in a hosted/multi-tenant deployment it's a **tenant-data leak** (onboarding one customer must never read another's model), and even locally it risks lifting another profile's filters / calculation text into this one. You don't need to: the packaged `sm add` command validates every item against the schema. Get the shape from `shared/metric-entity-shape.md` and the profile's **own** schema — never a sibling profile.
Don't propose metrics depending on choice-field literals you didn't detect, or cross-area metrics unless a cross-area edge wires the join (then put them under the cross-cutting area).

### 2d — Caveats, value_transforms, currency

From samples + the domain doc, add provider-portable cleaning where evidence supports it:
- **Caveats** (`caveats[]` on table/column/entity): data-quality notes, anti-patterns (e.g. "filter on the event date, not the load date"), dedup warnings.
- **value_transform** on columns whose raw value needs cleaning (`regexp_replace(...)` for bracketed text, `TO_TIMESTAMP(...)` for epoch). Must parse as SQL (validator checks).
- **default_filters** (`default_filters[]` on a table): soft-delete / tenancy filters AND-ed in at query time (use the `{alias}` placeholder, e.g. `{alias}.deleted_at IS NULL`).
- **Currency (one ask per profile):** **find the money columns with `sm suggest-units "$ROOT"` — don't hand-roll a name regex** (a bare `count` pattern matches inside `discount` and silently drops `discount_amount`; the command's matcher is word-boundary-correct and tested). It returns `{money_columns: [{area, table, column, type}]}` (numeric columns named like money — amount/price/revenue/discount/… — minus rate/count/id/score, and skipping any that already have a `unit`). Glance at the list; if a `_usd`/`_inr`-suffixed column makes the currency obvious, set it directly. Otherwise ask once: "What currency are these in?" (`USD`/`EUR`/`GBP`/`JPY`/`INR`/`Other`/`Mixed`). On the answer, apply it with **one tested command — never pipe `suggest-units` through a hand-rolled script** (that glue breaks, e.g. on empty stdin):

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" set-units "$ROOT" --currency INR
```

It stamps `unit` on every detected money column in a single validated curate batch. The runtime + chart renderer format the symbol + grouping **deterministically** from `unit` (`semantic_model/units.py`) — no prose caveat to re-interpret. `Mixed` → skip (leave `unit` unset), one-liner. Non-currency units (`cents`/`percent`/`days`) → `--unit <name>`; `--columns <table.col …>` to override the money detection for a non-obvious name.
- **Date encodings (auto-sniffed — no question):** introspection already sets `date_format` (`epoch_s`/`ms`/`us`/`ns`, `yyyymmdd`, `iso8601`) + `timezone` on date-named columns whose sample values fit the shape, so epoch integers render as human dates (UTC) deterministically. You don't ask. **Do** glance at the result: if a time column was missed or mis-scaled (e.g. an epoch_ms tagged epoch_s), fix it with a `field:date_format`/`field:timezone` edit op in the same batch; mention any epoch columns found in the Phase 7 summary.

**Write all of these with `sm curate` edit ops — never hand-edit `tables/*.yaml` or script a loop over them.** One ops array, one call (validated + committed + reverted on failure):
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate "$ROOT" --ops-file /tmp/agami-caveats.json
```
```json
[{"op":"edit","kind":"table","area":"main","name":"orders","field":"caveats","value":["Order total can be negative on refunds."]},
 {"op":"edit","kind":"table","area":"main","name":"orders","field":"default_filters","value":["{alias}.deleted_at IS NULL"]},
 {"op":"edit","kind":"table","area":"main","name":"events","column":"ts","field":"value_transform","value":"TO_TIMESTAMP(ts)"}]
```

### 2e — Reintrospect merge

On `reintrospect`, the engine rewrites the structural skeleton. **Preserve hand-edits**: descriptions, entities, metrics, caveats, value_transforms, and trust sign-offs (`confidence`/`review_state`/`signed_off_*`) carry over for tables/columns that still exist. Only structure the DB unambiguously reports (table list, columns, types, PK, FK) is refreshed. Mark entries `stale` only when their underlying column/table changed.

### 2f — Seed the narrative if the user didn't write one

ORGANIZATION.md is the human's narrative ONLY — it does **not** hold model facts. The factual summary (subject areas, conventions, the decoded glossary) is **derived from the structured model at read time** (`cli org-context` assembles it for the query path; the explorer shows it as a read-only field). The two homes stay separate by construction.

**Only on the skip path** (ORGANIZATION.md missing/empty, the user gave no narrative), **seed it with a short factual narrative** so `# About this database` reads as something, not a blank. You've just enriched every table — so write a **1–2 sentence description of what this database is about**, synthesised from the table/area descriptions (e.g. *"Tracks an electric-vehicle battery-swap network — stations, vehicles, battery packs, the swap transactions between them, and the alerts they raise."*). Write it under `# About this database` with the editable comment, and `chmod 600`. Keep it factual (don't invent business specifics you can't see); it's a starting **draft** the user edits.

If you can't summarise (no descriptions yet), fall back to the deterministic starter:
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" org-draft "$ROOT" > "$ROOT/ORGANIZATION.md"   # one-line factual seed
chmod 600 "$ROOT/ORGANIZATION.md"
```

If the user **did** write a narrative in 1.4, leave it untouched. The glossary from `set-terminology` (2b) needs no re-render — it's surfaced automatically by `org-context`. Mention in the Phase 7 summary that the glossary + summary are auto-derived and the narrative is theirs to edit.

---

## Phase 3: Review the subject-area split

The engine **proposes** the split (one area for small DBs; prefix-family clusters for large ones, each table owned once, cross-area joins as `cross_subject_area_relationships`). For a multi-area split, **surface it for the user to adjust** — boundaries are a curation decision, not a fact:

```
I split <N> tables into <A> subject areas:
  • <area1> — <t1, t2, …>
  • <area2> — <…>
<C> joins span areas (kept as cross-area relationships).
```

**The model explorer is the review surface — route adjustment through it, don't pre-empt it with a modal.** So:
- **Trivial split** (single area, or a handful of obviously-right areas with nothing else to curate): a quick **AskUserQuestion** `Looks good (Recommended)` / `Adjust — merge/rename/move (Other field)` is fine. Skip silently for a single-area small DB.
- **Non-trivial model** (many areas, or there's PII / proposed metrics / sign-offs pending — i.e. the Phase 4 curate gate will fire anyway): **make `Open the model explorer` the default** and let the user review the area split *there*, in one pass alongside PII, descriptions, and metric sign-off — rather than eyeballing a text table in a modal then opening the explorer separately. Don't ask the same thing twice.

If they adjust, edit the `subject_areas/` tree accordingly and re-validate (sizing warns at 25 tables, errors at 30).

**Replace each area's auto-proposed description with a real one** — the engine seeds `"Auto-proposed subject area covering: <tables>"`, which is boilerplate, but the **subject-area description is load-bearing**: it's what the MCP shows in its first pass so the LLM can ROUTE a question to the right area (`get_datasource_schema` returns name + description per area). A blank/boilerplate description means the router is guessing. So write one business line per area — what domain it covers and when you'd query it — grounded in its tables/columns (NOT product memory). Apply through the validated path, one batch (no generator script):
```bash
# one {op:edit, kind:subject_area, area:<name>, name:<name>, field:description, value:"<line>"} per area
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate "$ROOT" --ops-file /tmp/agami-area-desc.json
```

---

## Phase 4: Curate before examples — exclude + sign off what seeds depend on

Seeds reference **columns, tables, metrics, and entities** — so settle those *before* generating examples (a seed that uses a column you'd later exclude breaks at query time, and a seed built on an unreviewed metric bakes in a guessed definition). **Relationships are NOT gated here** — they stay lazy: FK joins are already auto-approved by the engine (the DB declared them), and inferred joins self-approve as you query / surface as receipt warnings. So you're not asked to rubber-stamp database-declared foreign keys.

**4a — The curate gate: open the explorer whenever there's anything to curate.** One call returns the decision (turn-boundary-safe — same answer on a fresh run or a resume):

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" curate-gate "$ROOT"
```
→ `{pii_count, preseed_count, should_open_explorer}`. **PII count** = columns flagged `sensitive` still queryable (an excluded column, or any column under an excluded table, isn't counted — so once the user excludes them it drops to 0 and the gate stops re-opening). **preseed count** = metrics + named-filters + entities needing sign-off (relationships are NOT gated — FK joins are engine-approved, inferred joins self-approve as you query).

**If `should_open_explorer` is true → invoke `/agami-model preseed` and END THE TURN.** The explorer is the **single** curation surface, with task-focused tabs so nothing is buried:
- the **PII tab** — every flagged column *and* every suspected-but-unflagged one (e.g. `first_name` in `sys_user`) in one list, each with a confirm/clear toggle. This is where the user reviews PII without hunting through tables.
- the **Metrics tab** — the proposed measures grouped by table and collapsed (`incident · 9 [✓ Approve 9]`), with per-table and "approve all proposed" bulk buttons, so a few-hundred-metric set signs off fast.
- the **Review** tab — metrics/entities/joins under "Needs your eyes" for anything needing a closer look; per-column **Exclude** toggles live on **Tables**.

Lead with one plain line of what's waiting — e.g. *"I flagged 12 PII columns and surfaced 8 more that look like PII, plus ~180 proposed metrics to sign off — opening the model explorer. Review on the PII and Metrics tabs and send the feedback block back when you're done."* — then **stop and wait** for their batch.

**Do NOT** present an inline `AskUserQuestion` to quick-exclude a few columns, and do NOT offer "continue now vs open explorer" here. The explorer **is** the exclude-and-review surface; a 4-option modal holds a fraction of what a real DB needs dropped, and splitting PII exclusion across a modal + the explorer is exactly the fragmented flow we're removing. (This replaces the old inline PII multiSelect — PII now routes through the explorer like every other exclusion.)

**If BOTH counts are 0 → surface "Nothing to curate before examples — proceeding"** and continue to Phase 5.

> **This gate OPENS the explorer; it is not a choice.** When either count is > 0 you open `/agami-model preseed` and end the turn. A high count is a reason to open it, not to skip it (bulk-approve the *Looks right* pile, eyeball PII + the cross-schema joins there). The "continue anyway" option exists **only** at the 4b return gate — after the user has been in the explorer at least once.

**4b — return gate:** when they're back, **recount the sign-offs** (`--scope preseed`). If **0** → Phase 5 (the seed command runs clean). If **> 0** (partial — they reviewed some and stopped) → AskUserQuestion: `Continue (Recommended)` (seeds run against current state; receipts warn) / `Pause — I'll finish review first` (end; resume via `/agami-connect`). This is the **only** place "continue to examples with items still unreviewed" is offered — and the **only** place you pass `seed-examples --after-review` (otherwise the preseed-review refusal is the engine telling you Phase 4 hasn't happened). **PII left un-excluded does NOT block seeds** — keeping a sensitive column queryable is the user's call; only unreviewed *sign-offs* gate the seeds.

On `reintrospect` with nothing flagged sensitive and nothing unreviewed, skip silently.

---

## Phase 5: Seed prompt examples

**Surface a progress warning first** (second-longest phase): "Generating NL→SQL seeds (a spread across your tables, metrics, entities, and joins — including cross-schema ones) and EXPLAIN-validating each against the live DB. Expect 1–3 min (longer on cloud / a multi-schema DB). I'll narrate per-example progress."

**5a — generate** (your job — the LLM step) candidate examples grounded in the model. Aim for **coverage and a good spread**, not a fixed count:

- **Shapes:** a count, a top-N, a time-bucketed trend, a breakdown, a recency filter. Anchor time filters to each table's `data_range` MAX (not `NOW()`) so seeds don't return 0 rows on a stale dataset.
- **Spread:** across the whole set, touch each major table/family, exercise **every approved metric at least once**, use the key **entities** by their real names/synonyms, and cover **representative joins** — intra-area *and* cross-schema.
- **Cross-schema seeds — the highest-value few-shots, include them deliberately.** Read the model's `cross_subject_area_relationships` (the cross-schema / cross-area joins). For the most meaningful ones, write a question a user would actually ask that **spans both schemas** — a fact/metric in one schema joined to the entity it references in another. Use the relationship's declared join (`on:` / from→to columns) and **schema-qualified** table names (it's one database — ordinary cross-schema SQL, fully EXPLAIN-able). Include **2–4** of these and make **1–2 genuinely complex** (3+ tables across two schemas, with an aggregation + a filter) — cross-schema SQL is exactly what NL→SQL gets wrong unaided, so a worked example pays off most here. (Cross-*profile* / federation seeds are out of scope — those need DuckDB ATTACH; this is cross-*schema* within one DB.)
- **Count scales with the model:** a single-schema DB is fine at ~10–12; a multi-schema one wants ~2–3 per subject area **plus** the 2–4 cross-schema seeds — don't undersample a 5-schema DB at a flat 12.

Tag each with its `tables` (list **all** tables it touches — both schemas for a cross-area one), `columns`, and `metric`. **Store a cross-area seed under its primary/driving table's area** (tagged with both schemas' tables, so the ranker can surface it from either side). Write the candidates as a JSON array to `/tmp/agami-seeds.json` — each: **required** `question`, `sql`; optional `tables`, `columns`, `metric`.

**5b+5c — validate + write in ONE packaged call.** **Do NOT write a script to loop EXPLAIN over the seeds and don't hand-write the YAML.** `seed-examples` validates every candidate against the live DB (wraps each as a zero-row query — dialect-agnostic, scans nothing), writes the passing ones (appends, dedups by `question`, commits), and returns the rejects with their DB error:
```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" seed-examples "$ROOT" --area <area> --profile <profile> --file /tmp/agami-seeds.json
```
Output `{added, written, committed, rejected:[{question, error}]}`. For each `rejected`, optionally regenerate once and re-run with just those; don't block the flow on a few drops. Corrections later append via `/agami-save-correction` (same `add-example` path).

> **The command enforces Phases 2 and 4 for you.** It runs two gates before writing anything:
> - `{refused: "columns_unenriched", unenriched_tables}` → a table got no column descriptions at all (you skipped the Phase-2 column pass). Go back, run the column pass on those tables, re-run. **NOT bypassable** — naked columns degrade every answer.
> - `{refused: "preseed_review_pending", pending_count}` → metrics/entities the seeds depend on are still unreviewed (you skipped the explorer-first review). **Go back to Phase 4a**, open `/agami-model preseed`, end the turn. Bypass only via `--after-review`, and **only** on the Phase-4b return path (the user has already been in the explorer and chose to continue with some items unreviewed). Never pass `--after-review` to force past a *fresh* refusal.

---

## Phase 6: Validate every seed example (the trust onboarding)

**Run every seed with ONE packaged call — `sm seed-validate` — never a hand-rolled "run all the seeds" script.** It executes each written seed against the live DB **through `execute_sql`** (the same path agami-query uses), so the **fan-trap / chasm-trap pre-flight + `default_filters` always apply** — a raw-connection driver could skip that safety and let a fan-out scan the whole table. It emits the examples-validation items (`{n, question, sql, row_headers, row_preview, row_count, state}`); a seed the pre-flight refuses or that errors comes back with its `error`, not a faked result:

```bash
bash "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/sm" seed-validate "$ROOT" --area <area> --profile <profile> > /tmp/agami-examples-items.json
```

(Heads-up before you run it: on a large warehouse this executes every seed for real — some may be full-scan aggregates that take a few minutes and cost warehouse compute. It's a one-time onboarding step; surface a one-liner so the wait is expected, and run it in the background if it's slow.)

Then render the examples-validation dashboard (per-profile subdir) from those items:

```bash
python3 "$AGAMI_PLUGIN_ROOT/scripts/render_examples_validation.py" \
  --items-file /tmp/agami-examples-items.json \
  --out "<artifacts_dir>/local/examples-validation/<profile>/<ts>.html"
```

The user reviews matches (green) / mismatches (red) with drill-down. This is the strongest "do these numbers match?" trust moment — surface it.

**Then END THE TURN and WAIT — do NOT continue to Phase 7/8 in the same message.** Like the Phase 4 gate, this is a hard stop: render the dashboard, give the one-line hand-off + the chat grammar (`approve` / `reject` / `edit` / `done`), and **stop**. The user is *in* the dashboard validating; printing the post-introspect summary or the "things you could ask" closing now (before they've validated) is exactly the bug we're avoiding. Re-render after each batch they send back, and only when they reply **`done`** (or have actioned every example) do you proceed to Phase 7.

Hand-off line (then end the turn):
```
Examples validated against your live DB → <artifacts_dir>/local/examples-validation/<profile>/<ts>.html
Open it: green = numbers match, red = mismatch (drill in to see the SQL).
Reply: approve N · reject N · edit N · done (when you're through).
```

**Processing the batch:** the dashboard emits `validate N` / `reject N` / `edit N` / `add example` / `note N` / `note all` — apply each through the **packaged commands**, never by hand-rewriting `examples.yaml`:
- **`validate N`** → the example is a trusted anchor; if the user signed in (the `by <email>` clause), stamp it via `sm add-example` (re-write the same example with `--signer`/`--role`).
- **`reject N`** → **`sm remove-example "$ROOT" --area <area> --question "<that example's exact question>"`** (`--signer`/`--role` to record who). It flags the example `status: rejected` — kept in `examples.yaml` for audit, dropped from the runtime ranker. **Do NOT hand-delete or hand-rewrite the YAML** (there's a command now); map `N` → the example's question from the items you rendered.
- **`edit N`** that fixes *that example's* SQL → re-write it with `sm add-example` (dedups by question, so it replaces). Re-run the new SQL to capture its number.

When the user gives a **cross-cutting display/formatting rule** (currency, units, number formatting — applies to many examples, not one), classify it like any correction (see [`agami-save-correction`](../agami-save-correction/SKILL.md) → "DISPLAY / FORMATTING preference"): a currency/unit fact attaches to the **column** (a `caveat`/`value_transform` in the shared model — org-wide by construction); a cross-cutting presentation convention → `ORGANIZATION.md`; a personal tic → `USER_MEMORY.md`. Don't reflexively file to USER_MEMORY, and don't reflexively ask — only ask if personal-vs-org is genuinely unclear. **Display rounding is a convention, not SQL** — a "show fewer decimals" rule → `ORGANIZATION.md`, never `ROUND()` baked into the example's SQL (that corrupts the exact-number verification anchor; the system formats numbers in full via `units.py`).

**`note all >>>…<<<` — the model-wide note. Apply it ONCE; the user never repeats themselves.** The dashboard has a "note for the whole model" box (separate from per-example `note N`). Its content arrives as a single **`note all >>>…<<<`** block. Treat it as one correction that applies across the board: classify it like any other (see [`agami-save-correction`](../agami-save-correction/SKILL.md)) and write it to the **right place, once** — a column `unit`/`caveat`/`value_transform` (a data fact: "amounts are in INR", "TOTAL can be negative"), a cross-cutting presentation convention → `ORGANIZATION.md`, a personal display tic → `USER_MEMORY.md`, or a filter/business rule the user wants applied → the relevant column/example. Then **re-render so every affected example reflects it**, and name where it landed in one line — *"Got it — set `<col>`'s unit to INR model-wide; it'll show on every example now."* If the user is still typing the same thing into per-example `note N` boxes, that's a smell: lift it to a single model-wide change and tell them they don't need to repeat it. (Formatting is just the common case — the rule is generic: any cross-cutting fact is stated once, written once, applied everywhere.) Note the result preview is already unit-formatted — `sm seed-validate` runs numbers through the same `units.py` as the live query path — so a money column showing a **bare** number means a missing column `unit`, not a per-example note.

### 6a — A bad number is the highest-value catch: fix it COMPLETELY, and ask in PLAIN language

Validation often surfaces a result that's *obviously wrong* — a bounded ratio averaging to a huge negative number, a "count" of 0, an alphabetically-sorted "trend." This almost always means a **data-quality** problem: sentinel/junk values in a column (encoded nulls / "not computed" markers stored as extreme numbers like ±1e9), a mis-typed column (a date stored as a string), or similar. This is the most valuable thing onboarding can find — handle it deliberately:

1. **Diagnose the cause** with a quick probe — `MIN`/`MAX`, and a small histogram (`COUNT` per coarse bucket) so you can SEE where the junk sits (sentinels show up as a sharp spike at an absurd value, separated by a gap from the real data). Confirm what's actually wrong before proposing a fix.

2. **Exclude the SENTINELS — do NOT clip to a "textbook" range.** The bug is junk values, not real-but-extreme data, and the two are easy to confuse. Don't reflexively clamp to the range you *expect*: many columns legitimately pass their "obvious" bounds — a ratio can exceed 1 when its numerator really can exceed its denominator, an age can be 0, a balance can be negative — and clipping to the expected range silently drops real (often the most important) records and biases the result. Cut **only** the implausible sentinels (the absurd spike), and **when the line between "junk" and "legitimate-but-extreme" is unclear, ask the user for the real valid range — that's the user's domain knowledge, not something to guess.**

3. **Fix it at EVERY level the bad data reaches — not just the seed.** A contaminated column poisons *three* paths, and fixing one leaves the others broken:
   - the **seed example** itself → correct its SQL;
   - any **metric** whose `bindings` SQL touches that column → guard the binding (wrap the aggregate in a `CASE WHEN <col> BETWEEN <lo> AND <hi> THEN <col> END`, with bounds drawn from the distribution + the user's domain input — never a hard-coded "textbook" range), and update its `calculation` prose to match;
   - **ad-hoc questions** that aggregate the column without naming the metric → add a **caveat** on the column (state the sentinel values to exclude, plus any non-obvious valid range the user confirmed) so the SQL generator guards them too.
   Use a `caveat` for this (advisory steer), NOT a `default_filter` (that wrongly drops the whole row from every query) and NOT a `value_transform` (you can't cleanly sanitize a sentinel). Apply all of it in **one `sm curate` batch**; keep any signed-off metric `approved` and re-stamp `signed_off_at` (the user is re-vetting the corrected definition).

4. **Ask ONE plain-language question — about the NUMBER, never the model's vocabulary.** A first-time user does not know what "bindings" or "caveats" are and cannot be asked to choose between them. **Never surface those words in the question.** Frame it by the wrong number and the consequence, in the user's own domain terms, and make the **complete fix the recommended default**. The skill decides *what* to edit; the user only confirms *whether* to fix (and, when the valid range is ambiguous, confirms that range). The pattern below is the *shape* — fill it with the user's actual column, value, and domain, not these placeholders:
   > The average <column> came out as **<impossible value>**, which can't be right — some rows hold junk values (e.g. <absurd sentinel>) that look like an encoded "missing", not a real <column>. I'd leave those out. One thing to confirm: can <column> legitimately go past <expected bound> in your data? If so I'll keep those — they look like the records that matter most. Want me to fix it?
   > • **Fix it everywhere (recommended)** — agami leaves the junk values out whenever it works with <column> (this metric and any question that uses it).
   > • Just fix this one example — leave everything else as-is.
   > • Leave it for now — I'll note it; you can fix it later.

   On **"Fix it everywhere"** → apply the seed + metric-binding + column-caveat edits as one batch. Do **not** present a "patch the bindings vs add a caveat" choice — that's the skill's call, not the user's. (If the user is technical and asks for the detail, then show it.)

---

## Phase 7: Post-introspect summary (MANDATORY — NEVER SKIP)

**Sequencing gate (read first):** Phases 7–8 run **only after the user has finished validating** — i.e. after they replied `done` (or actioned everything) at the Phase 6 examples gate, and after the Phase 4 curate gate returned. **Never print this summary or the Phase 8 closing in the same turn that you rendered a dashboard, and never while the user is mid-review.** If a dashboard (Phase 4 review, Phase 6 validation) is still open and unanswered, you should have ended the turn there — wait for the user, don't summarize over them.

Runs on **every** invocation that produces or refreshes a model — even if Phase 4 found nothing and all entries auto-approved. Lead with the **must-do** count, break out optional polish separately.

Scan the model; count by `confidence`/`review_state`/type:

```
agami-connect just ran. Here's what we found:

  ✓  <N> tables, <M> columns across <A> subject areas   (structure)
  ✓  <C>% of columns described                           (from `sm coverage` — never 0%)
  ✓  <K> relationships with join cardinality              (<E> confirmed from declared FKs)
  ⚠  <R1> inferred/probed relationships                   (review — confirm the join)
  ⚠  <R2> proposed metrics                                (sign-off — Rule 1)
  ✓  <S> sensitive columns flagged (never extracted)

  <R2 + stale> items need your sign-off to start querying.
  <R1> low-confidence joins can wait — they surface as warnings on the answers
  that use them and self-approve as you query.
```
(Omit any zero line. The closing two lines are mandatory — they tell the user "you can ship now; the tail is optional.")

Then **AskUserQuestion**: `Open the review queue` (→ `/agami-model review` — sign off the pending metrics/entities) / `Browse the full model` (→ `/agami-model` — explore + exclude tables/columns) / `Skip — I'll review later` (default). If a sibling skill isn't built yet, omit that option — don't error.

---

## Phase 8: Follow-up suggestions

(No telemetry — agami has none; don't surface anything about it.)

**8a — gate on Rule 1 status:** count metrics/named-filters with `review_state != approved`. If > 0, use the **in-progress** framing (8b); else the **fully-set-up** framing (8c). Unsigned Rule 1 metrics don't *block* queries — agami still answers — but an answer that uses one carries a "not signed off yet" **warning** on its receipt until you approve it, so reviewing them is still worth doing.

**8b — in-progress:**
```
✓ <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/ — semantic model (<A> subject areas, validated)
✓ prompt_examples/ — <N> NL→SQL examples
⚠ <rule1_unreviewed> metric proposal(s) not signed off yet:
   - <M> metric proposal(s)
You can ask anything now — answers that use an unsigned metric just come with a
"not signed off yet" note on the receipt until you approve it.

Five things you could ask:
1.–5. <count / top-N / time-bucket / breakdown / recency — grounded in real tables>
Pick a number, or keep going:
• /agami-model review — sign off the pending metrics (+ review joins/entities) to clear the warnings.
• /agami-model — browse the whole model and refine it (exclude raw PII / staging tables, edit descriptions).
• Ask questions — if an answer's off, say "save this as a correction" and I'll teach the model.
```

**8c — fully set up:**
```
✓ <artifacts_dir>/<profile>/ — semantic model (<A> subject areas, validated)
✓ prompt_examples/ — <N> NL→SQL examples
✓ All metrics signed off

Now that <profile> is set up, here are five things you could ask:
1.–5. <count / top-N / trend / breakdown / narrative — grounded in the schema's distinctive tables>
Reply with a number, or ask anything else.

The model keeps improving as you use it:
• Just ask questions — and if an answer looks off, say "save this as a correction"
  (or paste the right SQL) and I'll teach the model so next time is right.
• /agami-model — one dashboard to review & sign off metrics/joins/entities (Review tab),
  exclude tables/columns you don't want queried, add metrics, and edit descriptions.
```
End the turn. Picking a number routes the question into query-database. Keep each suggestion under 80 chars and grounded in real tables.

---

## Phase 8.5: Cross-profile link offer (ONLY when ≥2 profiles now exist)

**Gate:** run this **only** when, after this onboarding, the user has **two or more** onboarded profiles (count distinct onboarded profiles — `<artifacts_dir>/*/org.yaml`, or `[section]`s in `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials`). Skip entirely for the first/only profile, and skip on a plain `reintrospect` of a single-profile setup. This is the **cross-datasource** case — different databases, joined at query time via federation (Phase 2b.federation in agami-query), declared in `<artifacts_dir>/local/cross_profile_relationships.yaml`. Unlike cross-*schema* joins (same DB, auto-detected — Case 1), cross-*profile* links are **never** auto-detected at introspection: each profile is a separate connection, so there's nothing to confirm by overlap.

**Ask (opt-in, AskUserQuestion):**
> You now have <N> databases connected (`<profileA>`, `<profileB>`, …). Want me to look for likely links between them — so you can ask questions that span both (e.g. join `<profileA>`'s data to `<profileB>`'s)?

Options (no `(Recommended)` — it's the user's call): `Yes — look for links` / `Not now` (default).

**On "Not now":** one line — *"No problem. Say 'link my databases' anytime, or hand-edit `<artifacts_dir>/local/cross_profile_relationships.yaml`."* End.

**On "Yes":**
1. **Propose candidates by name+type** — compare the just-onboarded profile's columns against the other profile(s)' columns (read each model's tables/columns; no DB access needed). A candidate is a column pair with the **same or obviously-equivalent name** (`dept_id` ↔ `department_id`, `customer_id` ↔ `cust_id`) **and a compatible type**, where one side is a key/grain column. Rank by name closeness.
2. **Be honest about confidence.** Say plainly: *"These are name/type guesses — I can't sample-join across two separate databases to confirm them, so they're lower-confidence than the joins inside one DB. They'll prove out the first time a federated query uses them."* Never present them as confirmed.
3. **Confirm each, never auto-write.** Show the candidates (`<profileA>.<schema>.<table>.<col>  →  <profileB>.<schema>.<table>.<col>`) and let the user pick which to keep (multi-select) or skip all.
4. **Write the confirmed ones** to `<artifacts_dir>/local/cross_profile_relationships.yaml` in the format [agami-query expects](../agami-query/SKILL.md) — **merge**, never clobber an existing file (load it, append new entries, dedup by the `from_profile/from_dataset/to_profile/to_dataset` tuple), `chmod 600`:
   ```yaml
   version: "0.1.1"
   relationships:
     - name: <profileA>_<tableA>_to_<profileB>_<tableB>
       from_profile: <profileA>
       from_dataset: <schema>.<table>
       from_columns: [<col>]
       to_profile: <profileB>
       to_dataset: <schema>.<table>
       to_columns: [<col>]
       description: <one line — what the link means, in the user's terms>
   ```
5. **Confirm where it landed** — *"Saved <K> cross-database link(s) to `<artifacts_dir>/local/cross_profile_relationships.yaml`. A question that spans both DBs will now use them (federated via DuckDB). I'll flag low confidence on the first answer that does."* Don't block; this is additive.

## Error handling

| Symptom | Action |
|---|---|
| Credentials chmod wrong | Refuse, offer to `chmod 600` |
| Cached connection tool no longer works | Re-detect, update `<artifacts_dir>/local/.config` |
| Catalog denied (no `information_schema`/PRAGMA/dict access) | Engine falls back to probe mode; if even table enumeration is denied, ask for the table allowlist (Phase 1.2) |
| Introspection SQL fails | Route through `db_error_classifier.md`; surface the one-line remediation |
| **Validator fails** | **Model is NOT persisted. Show errors verbatim, fix, re-validate.** |
| EXPLAIN fails for a seed | Auto-fix once → else move to `<artifacts_dir>/local/.rejected/`. Don't block. |
| Reintrospect would lose hand-edits | Phase 2e — preserve descriptions, entities, metrics, caveats, sign-offs |
| Legacy (v1) model at the profile root | Engine backs it up to `.legacy_backup/` before writing; surface a one-liner |
| Unsupported engine (MongoDB, Cassandra, …) | "Not supported yet — supported: Postgres/Redshift/Supabase, MySQL, Snowflake, BigQuery, SQL Server, Oracle, Databricks, Trino, DuckDB, SQLite." |
