# Golden dataset YAML shape — the canonical reference

This is the **sanctioned source of truth** for the shape of a golden-dataset
YAML — a file of questions whose answers are already agreed, used to gate a run.
The data below is **synthetic** (the shipped sample `store` database: orders,
customers, channels) — it exists to show the *structure*, never to be copied as
content.

> **HARD RULE — never read another profile to learn a shape.**
> Do **not** glob or read other profiles' artifacts (e.g.
> `find <artifacts_dir> -path '*/golden_datasets/*.yaml'`, or reading
> `<artifacts_dir>/<some-other-profile>/...`) to "copy the file shape." That
> crosses the profile boundary, and it crosses it *harder* here than anywhere
> else: a golden dataset is the business definitions **and the answer key in one
> file**, so a glob returns another customer's questions together with the SQL
> that correctly answers them. In a hosted / multi-tenant deployment that is a
> **tenant-data leak**; even locally it lifts another profile's *business
> definitions* (filters, calculation text, the questions they care about).

## The dataset file

A dataset lives at `<artifacts_dir>/<profile>/golden_datasets/<name>.yaml` — the
committable half of the profile, beside `prompt_examples/`, so a team reviews
its answer key the way it reviews its few-shot library. Only `*.yaml` is read; a
`*.yml` stray is reported rather than silently skipped.

**The filename stem is the dataset's name.** `orders.yaml` is the dataset
`orders`, so the YAML must **not** declare a `name:` key — a second place to
declare it would disagree with the first and nothing on disk would say which
won. A file that declares one is refused.

Dataset-level fields: `description` (optional prose), `category` (optional —
free text, a way to group datasets), `user_context` (optional — who is asking,
and what they assume), `test_cases` (optional; a file with no cases yet is a
legal in-progress shape, not a fault).

A complete file — one minimal case, one exercising every optional field, and
one held to a band:

```yaml
description: Order-volume questions over the sample store database.
category: orders
user_context: An operations analyst who only ever counts orders that were paid for.
test_cases:
  - id: orders-count
    query: How many orders have been placed?
    expected:
      sql: SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders
      sql_confirmed: true

  - id: orders-paid-by-channel-2024
    query: How many paid orders came through each channel in 2024?
    expected:
      sql: >
        SELECT channel, COUNT(*) AS order_count
        FROM orders
        WHERE status = 'paid'
          AND placed_at >= '2024-01-01' AND placed_at < '2025-01-01'
        GROUP BY channel
        ORDER BY order_count DESC
      sql_confirmed: true
      tables_used: [orders]
      chart_type: bar
      data_shape: category_value
      validation_notes: Counted at order grain, so nothing joins in to fan the count out.
    match: exact
    must_filter: [status]
    recorded:
      at: '2026-01-14T09:00:00Z'
    tags: [orders, smoke]
    confirmed_by:
      method: reviewed against the sample seed by hand
      at: '2026-01-14T09:00:00Z'

  - id: orders-refunded-count
    query: How many orders have been refunded?
    expected:
      sql: SELECT COUNT(*) AS order_count FROM orders WHERE status = 'refunded'
      sql_confirmed: true
    match: bounded
    bounds:
      min_rows: 1
      max_rows: 1
      min_value: 0
      max_value: 500
```

## Test cases

Each entry under `test_cases` is one question and its answer key. `id`
(**required** — the author's own, and the key every stored result hangs off, so
it must not be renamed casually; an id repeated within one file is reported and
that second case is dropped, the first kept — so copy-pasting a case means
changing its id too) and `query` (**required** — the question as a user would
ask it). `expected` is **required** and holds the answer key:
`sql_confirmed` (**required**, boolean), `sql` (optional), `tables_used`,
`chart_type`, `data_shape`, `validation_notes` (all optional).

`sql_confirmed: true` **requires an `expected.sql`** and is refused without one.
A confirmed case is the only kind that can fail a run, so it is the only kind
that has to be comparable against something; with no SQL it would pass forever
and nobody would notice. An unconfirmed case with no SQL is legal — that is the
in-progress shape, and it simply cannot gate.

Alongside `expected`, an item takes six optional fields:

- `match` — how closely the run has to match the answer key, loosening left to
  right: `exact`, `values`, `shape`, `bounded`, `nonempty`. **Defaults to
  `exact`**, so an item that says nothing is held to the strictest reading. Any
  other word is refused. Loosen only for a reason the answer itself gives:
  columns pair by value at every level, so differing names or order never call
  for it. `values` forgives a floating-point tail **and an extra column**, which
  makes it right for a result carrying a real float and wrong for a count — the
  extra column it waves through is the most common way a generated statement is
  wrong.
- `bounds` — the band `match: bounded` is judged against: `min_rows` /
  `max_rows` on the number of rows, and `min_value` / `max_value` on a
  single-cell numeric answer. All four keys are optional but at least one has to
  be set — a band that names nothing bounds nothing. A negative row count, or a
  floor above its own ceiling, is refused. **`bounds` and `match: bounded` are a
  pair, and either one alone is refused**: `bounded` with no band has nothing to
  compare against, and a band under any other level is read by nothing. Both
  halves would keep passing, which is why neither can be written on its own.
- `must_filter` — the **column names** a correct statement has to filter on
  (`must_filter: [status]` — not the predicate, just the column). A statement
  that does not filter on every column listed fails. This is how a case gates
  *how* the answer was reached, not just what it came to.
- `recorded` — `at`: when the answer was accepted. **Never the comparison
  target** — a run is judged against `expected`, which is re-executed live at
  score time, not against anything recorded here. It does not carry the
  query's result rows: the golden-datasets directory has no gitignore
  exclusion, so a row-carrying receipt would commit a query's actual result to
  version control on every save.
- `tags` — free text. `smoke` is a **convention** for the fast subset, not a
  keyword the reader knows or treats specially.
- `confirmed_by` — `method` (required within the block, free text) and `at`:
  who or what vouched for the answer key, and when.

**An unknown field is refused, not ignored** — and what it costs depends on
where it is. A typo'd `must_filters` **on a case** does not quietly become a
case with no filters that gates nothing: the reader drops that one case, names
the field, and everything else in the file still reads. A bad key at the **top
level of the file** — a typo'd `descriptoin:`, or a `description:` left with no
value while an edit is half-finished — is refused at the dataset, so the whole
file is dropped and every valid case in it goes with it. Re-read after editing
the top of a file.

**A relative question over a frozen answer key is reported as a dataset error.**
A question like *"how many orders last quarter?"* names a window that slides
forward on its own; SQL pinned to `placed_at >= '2024-01-01'` does not. The two
agree today and drift apart on their own. Either anchor the SQL to the current
date (`CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '90 days'`, `NOW()`, the dialect's spelling) or
rewrite the question to name the window it means, as
`orders-paid-by-channel-2024` above does. The item is still read — the case is
broken, not the model, and a runner that scored it as a failure would blame the
wrong thing.

## How to write them

Two supported ways in, and both land the same shape.

**`/agami-save-golden` is the skill that writes these.** It has two doors: a
question bank (a CSV, or a table pasted into chat) imports as items, after the
parsed rows have been shown and agreed to — a row with no statement lands
`sql_confirmed: false` (a question with nothing yet to check), and a row that
already carries a statement lands `sql_confirmed: true` with `confirmed_by`
naming the sheet as the source, because a statement someone put in the sheet is
an answer they are vouching for, not a draft this door invents. The other door
takes one question with the statement that answered it and the result somebody
just looked at, and saves it as a confirmed item with its `confirmed_by`. It is
append-only — a write that would change an item that already exists stops and
shows the before and the after — and every write is re-read through the reader
below before it is kept.

**Or write the file by hand**, one dataset per question area, and read it back
before relying on it — the reader reports per-file and per-case, so one bad case
costs one case rather than the suite:

```bash
python -c "from semantic_model.golden import load_golden_datasets; \
  d, r = load_golden_datasets('<profile>'); print(r.findings or 'clean', len(d))"
```

Findings name the file and the case (`orders.yaml[orders-count]`), so fix what
is named and re-read. Keep the ids stable: results already stored against an id
detach the moment it is renamed.
