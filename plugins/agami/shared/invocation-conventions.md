# Invocation conventions — read this BEFORE telling the user to invoke a skill

agami ships nine skills, all prefixed `agami-` to avoid colliding with Claude Code's built-in slash commands (e.g. `/init`) and with other plugins:

| Skill | Slash command | Natural-language triggers (via `when_to_use`) |
|---|---|---|
| agami-connect | `/agami-connect` | "set up agami", "connect to my database", "introspect the schema", "reload the schema", "reintrospect", "add a new database" |
| agami-query | `/agami-query` | any data question — "how many", "show me", "top N", "trend over time", etc. |
| agami-model | `/agami-model` | "open the model explorer", "show me the model", "exclude a table", "remove this column" — AND review/sign-off: "open the review dashboard", "review my model", "sign off the metrics", "approve N", "walk the review queue" (its Review tab absorbed the former `/agami-review`) |
| agami-save-correction | `/agami-save-correction` | "save this as a correction", "remember this", "use this SQL next time" |
| agami-reconcile | `/agami-reconcile` | "reconcile against this dashboard", "do these numbers match?", "validate against my Tableau export", "here is the SQL behind each tile", "validate this query part by part", "audit this SQL", "check these questions" — and after a run: "keep these as golden questions", "promote these to a golden dataset" |
| agami-eval | `/agami-eval` | "run the evals", "run the golden dataset", "score the model against my golden questions", "did anything regress?", "how accurate is agami on my data?" |
| agami-save-golden | `/agami-save-golden` | "save this as a golden question", "add this to the golden dataset", "import my question bank", "turn this spreadsheet into a golden dataset", "show me the golden datasets", "what does this dataset not test", "apply my queued changes" |
| agami-serve | `/agami-serve` | "set up agami for Claude Desktop", "use agami in the Claude app", "hook up the MCP server", "let me test what my end users would see" |
| agami-deploy | `/agami-deploy` | "deploy agami", "self-host agami", "set up the agami server for my team", "host agami on a VM" (early access — in testing) |

**`/agami-init` no longer exists** — its credential-setup flow was folded into `/agami-connect` Phase 0a. Users who haven't run setup before invoke `/agami-connect`; the skill detects missing credentials and runs the DB-type picker + writes `<artifacts_dir>/local/credentials.example` inline before introspecting.

## What works

| Form | Notes |
|---|---|
| `/agami-<skill>` (e.g. `/agami-connect`) | Works as a bare slash command across hosts. The `agami-` prefix is what makes them safe. |
| Plain natural language | Each skill's `when_to_use` carries trigger phrases. The model routes correctly without an explicit slash command. **Prefer this in chat** — it reads more naturally. |
| `@agami` at-mention (some hosts) | Some Claude Code hosts autocomplete `@agami` to the skill list. Don't assume it works on every host. |

## What does NOT work — never write these in user-facing text

The model often reaches for slash patterns it's seen on other plugins. None of these exist in users' installations:

- `/agami:connect`, `/agami:query-database`, etc. — colon-namespaced forms **do not exist**.
- `/init`, `/connect`, `/query-database`, etc. — bare forms without the `agami-` prefix. **`/init` collides with Claude Code's built-in `/init`** (which generates a CLAUDE.md), so we explicitly avoid it. The others are too generic and collide with other plugins.
- `/agami-init` — **deprecated and removed.** Its flow now lives at `/agami-connect` Phase 0a. If you see references in older docs, ignore them.
- `/agami-review` — **removed.** Its trust-review dashboard was folded into `/agami-model` (the Review tab). Use `/agami-model` (or `/agami-model review` to open straight on the sign-off queue). Ignore older references.
- `agami init`, `agami connect` (no slash, no @) — **do not exist** as commands.
- `@agami:init`, `@agami:connect` — colon-namespaced @-forms **do not exist**.

If you're tempted to write any of those, stop and re-read this doc.

## How to phrase guidance to the user

For most chat replies, **prefer natural-language phrasing over slash commands** — it reads better and the `when_to_use` matcher routes correctly.

| Instead of… | Say… |
|---|---|
| "Run `/agami-connect reintrospect`" | "Say 'reload the schema' and I'll re-introspect from your DB." |
| "Run `/agami-save-correction`" | "Say 'save this as a correction' and I'll add it to the examples library." |
| "Run `/agami-review`" (removed) | "Say 'open the review dashboard' to walk the sign-off queue." (routes to `/agami-model`'s Review tab) |
| "Type `/agami-query`" | Just answer the question directly. Slash commands are unnecessary. |

## When the model invents a new form

If you find yourself about to write `/init`, `/connect`, `/agami:connect`, `/agami connect`, or any other variation, stop. Either use the `agami-` prefix (e.g. `/agami-connect`) or use natural language. There is no third option.

## Passing JSON to `sm` (`--ops-file` / `--file`) — always write it with the Write tool

Every `sm` command that takes a JSON file (`curate --ops-file`, `add --file`,
`add-example --file`, `seed-examples --file`, `format-table --units`) expects a real
JSON file. **Create it with the Write tool — never a heredoc, a shell variable
(`printf '%s' "$OPS"`), or `python3 -c`.** JSON quotes get mangled by shell quoting,
and JSON `null` / `true` / `false` are not valid Python — pasting a review-items entry
(which has `null` fields) into `python3 -c` is what produces
`NameError: name 'null' is not defined`. The Write tool writes the bytes literally, so
quotes and `null` survive. Keep ops minimal (the locator + action), not whole items.
