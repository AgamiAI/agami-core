"""
Tier 3 — Python execution helper.

Reads <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials (INI), opens a connection to the configured
database via the appropriate Python driver, runs ONE SQL statement, and
writes the result as RFC 4180 CSV to stdout. Stdlib + driver-only.

The agami skill calls this when it detects tier=python in <artifacts_dir>/local/.config
(meaning native CLI tools are unavailable but the relevant Python driver
is importable). Connect-side and query-database both shell out to:

    python3 scripts/execute_sql.py --profile <profile> --sql-file <path>

The --sql-file form is preferred over --sql so SQL containing quotes,
backticks, or `$` doesn't get mangled by the shell.

Credentials resolve env-first then file: a DSN in DATASOURCE_URL[__<PROFILE>] (the
self-host channel), else <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials. Connects ONLY to the
host/port that resolution yields. Never substitutes localhost. Never asks for
credentials. Hard exits with a clear message if neither source has them.

Drivers (install only what you need):
    pip install psycopg2-binary             # Postgres / Redshift
    pip install pymysql                     # MySQL
    pip install snowflake-connector-python  # Snowflake
    pip install google-cloud-bigquery       # BigQuery
    # SQLite uses the stdlib `sqlite3` module — no install needed.

Exit codes:
    0  — success, CSV on stdout
    1  — SQL rejected by the read-only guard (kind="permission" JSON on stderr)
    2  — usage / config error (missing credentials, bad profile, etc.)
    3  — driver missing for the configured db type
    4  — connection / authentication failed
    5  — SQL execution error (syntax, unknown column, etc.)

    problems the file has under a container uid that doesn't own it.

    Scope / gotchas (deliberately minimal — the file remains the fuller channel):

        mysql / snowflake / bigquery / sqlite). A warehouse type without a DSN scheme
        (databricks, oracle, sqlserver, trino, duckdb) still uses the per-field file.
      - The value is stripped (secret stores / `.env` / `$(cat file)` commonly append a
        trailing newline, which would otherwise mis-parse), and an empty-or-whitespace-only
        value is treated as unset (falls through to the next source) — set the var to a real
        DSN to take effect; don't set it to "" expecting to *disable* one.
