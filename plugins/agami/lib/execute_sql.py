"""
Tier 3 — Python execution helper.

Reads <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials (INI), opens a connection to the configured
database via the appropriate Python driver, runs ONE SQL statement, and
writes the result as RFC 4180 CSV to stdout. Stdlib + driver-only.

The agami skill calls this when it detects tier=python in <artifacts_dir>/local/.config
(meaning native CLI tools are unavailable but the relevant Python driver
is importable). Connect-side and query-database both shell out to:

    python3 scripts/execute_sql.py --profile <profile> --sql-file <path>

The --sql-file form is preferred over --sql so SQL containing quotes,
backticks, or `$` doesn't get mangled by the shell.

Credentials resolve env-first then file: a DSN in DATASOURCE_URL[__<PROFILE>] (the
self-host channel), else <artifacts_dir>/local/credentials. Connects ONLY to the
host/port that resolution yields. Never substitutes localhost. Never asks for
credentials. Hard exits with a clear message if neither source has them.

Drivers (install only what you need):
    pip install psycopg2-binary             # Postgres / Redshift
    pip install pymysql                     # MySQL
    pip install snowflake-connector-python  # Snowflake
    pip install google-cloud-bigquery       # BigQuery
    # SQLite uses the stdlib `sqlite3` module — no install needed.

Exit codes:
    0  — success, CSV on stdout
    1  — refused by a guard. `main` writes the contract `{"refusal": {…}}` as a single JSON object
         on stderr, and nothing else — every branch is converted now. Four once wrote their own
         `{"error": {…}}` or plain-text diagnostic line BEFORE it, which made the stream two lines
         and readable only by a line-scanning parser: the default-filter and auto-rewrite notices
         went with the rewrites they announced, and the fan/chasm and sensitive-column
         diagnostics went with the refusals they explained. Parsers should still key off the
         `"refusal"` KEY rather than the code or the line count.
    2  — usage / config error (missing credentials, bad profile, etc.)
    3  — driver missing for the configured db type
    4  — connection / authentication failed
    5  — SQL execution error (syntax, unknown column, etc.)
    6  — an unanticipated error inside the guarded path (`Failure.kind == "other"`). It has a code of
         its own precisely so it does not borrow one: with `other` falling to the generic 2, a parent
         reading the exit code back reported an internal break as a datasource-configuration problem
         (`dsn`), and only on the fork transport, while the identical break in-process said `other`.
    7  — the statement referenced a column the database does not have
    8  — the statement referenced a table the database does not have
    9  — the connection's role lacks SELECT on a referenced object
    10 — the database was unreachable mid-statement (connection refused / reset)

Codes 7-10 exist for the same reason 6 does. The child classifies a driver error at the chokepoint
and then `main` collapses that classification to an exit code, so a kind without a code of its own is
a kind the fork silently loses: all four landed on the `other` default and a parent read them back as
`other`, while the identical error in-process reported the real kind. The in-process tests passed and
the DEFAULT surface was wrong (ACE-039).

`EXIT_TO_FAILURE_KIND` / `FAILURE_KIND_TO_EXIT` below are that table in code — this module owns the
exit-code contract because it documents it here and is the only place that produces it.

        mysql / snowflake / bigquery / sqlite). A warehouse type without a DSN scheme
        (databricks, oracle, sqlserver, trino, duckdb) still uses the per-field file.
      - The value is stripped (secret stores / `.env` / `$(cat file)` commonly append a
        trailing newline, which would otherwise mis-parse), and an empty-or-whitespace-only
        value is treated as unset (falls through to the next source) — set the var to a real
        DSN to take effect; don't set it to "" expecting to *disable* one.
      - Tokens fold every non-alphanumeric char to `_`, so ids differing only in

# own wire shape holding still, which is exactly what principle 7's re-derivation bar cannot rest on.
#
# It has to travel out-of-band because the tool handler returns a `str`: by the time the transport
# runs its `finally`, the Envelope is gone and a serialized body is all there is. Same mechanism and
# same reasoning as `_last_error_detail` directly above, including the clear-on-entry — a verdict
# left behind by an earlier call must never label this one — and the same reason it is a ContextVar
# rather than a module global: the in-process path runs tool handlers on worker threads.
#
# **Read by the TRANSPORT, out of a context it owns.** That is not a detail — a ContextVar set
# inside `async_offload.run_blocking`'s worker thread is invisible to the caller and to every other
# worker, because anyio hands the thread a COPY of the context. Verified rather than assumed: a var
# set in one `run_blocking` reads back `None` both in the request task and in a second
# `run_blocking`. So `mcp_http` runs the handler inside its own `contextvars.copy_context()` and
# reads the result out of that object afterwards. A plain "set here, read there" would silently
# record nothing on the one surface that records tool calls at all.
#
# `(status, rule, row_count)`, not the whole Envelope: the transport needs to say whether the call
# succeeded, which gate stopped it, and how many rows came back. Putting a contract object in here
# invites somebody to serialize it from the transport instead of from the one place that owns the

#     engine's emission order is not a promise — so the ORDER BY is what turns "some rows" into "the
#     rows you asked for", and it is named first for that reason.
#   * An AGGREGATE cannot. `LIMIT` on a grouped result silently drops groups, and a partial breakdown
#     reads exactly like a complete one: no row is wrong, the total is. That is a worse outcome than
#     the refusal the caller just got. The REMEDIATION does not warn against `LIMIT`; it does not
#     mention it at all. The reader here is usually an LLM, negation is what an LLM follows least
#     reliably, and "do not add a LIMIT" puts the token in front of it either way. Absence is the
#     stronger control, and it is also what makes the acceptance check a plain one.
#
#     Scoped to the remediation deliberately: the shared `detail` says "the {N}-row limit", and that
#     stays. It is prose naming the ceiling, not an instruction to write a clause — the same thing
#     ACE-038's timeout detail does with its seconds — and the remediation is the field a caller acts
#     on. Stripping the word from the detail too would cost the caller the one number they need.
#   * None means nothing parsed the statement — the vendored mirror has no `runtime` to call, and
#     `no_safety=True` skips the pass that sets the shape. Guessing "listing" here would hand an
#     aggregate caller the one instruction that corrupts their answer, so this text hands the fork
#     back to the caller, who does know which they wrote, and makes `LIMIT` conditional on it.
# The keys are exactly `runtime.statement_shape`'s return domain, and the lookup below is direct

    The one place a deployment can turn off the 4b/4c half of the guard: table scope, column scope,
    the star ban, the readability and scopability gates, the three `model_unavailable` branches, and
    the engine-mismatch check. It exists because those refuse on facts about OUR parser and OUR model
    resolution rather than about the caller's statement: a dialect drift or a model that will not
    resolve refuses EVERY query on the server until an operator intervenes, and until this switch
    there was no way to bring a server up without them.

    **It cannot reach the gates that stop a statement writing, calling a dangerous function, or
    outrunning its bounds**, and that much is structural rather than a rule to remember:
    `check_read_only` and `check_no_recon` are composed in `execute_guarded` ABOVE the semantic-model
    pass, the resource bounds are applied around the executor below it, and `sql_guard` imports only
    `re` and `typing` so neither gate degrades when the pass is skipped. The least-privilege
    read-only DB role, the primary control F9 names with this layer as defense-in-depth, is untouched
    either way.

    **What it DOES reach, stated plainly because the honest version is short and the flattering one
    is wrong:** with the pass off, a statement may name any table and any column the connecting role
    can read, including columns deliberately excluded from the model, which is the only mechanism
    REQ-021 offers for "this must not be readable". `SELECT *` is permitted, so one star returns every
    physical column. And **schema enumeration through catalog RELATIONS is reachable**:
    `check_no_recon` denies catalog FUNCTIONS, while `information_schema.tables`, `pg_catalog.pg_class`
    and `sqlite_master` in a FROM clause were only ever refused by `check_table_scope`, which is
    inside this pass. The read-only grant this project recommends does not revoke catalog access, so
    with the pass off nothing backstops it. See ACE-102, which moves catalog relations into
    `check_no_recon` so that half becomes structural too.

    Default OFF deliberately inverts the fail-closed default every other gate takes, and the
    inversion is written into REQ-014 rather than left as drift between the register and this file.
    The carve-out is standing, not time-boxed: no trigger retires it.

    Read per call rather than cached at import, like `_hosted()` above and
    `oidc.public_signup_enabled` whose parsing this copies, so flipping the variable on a running
    deployment takes effect on the next request with no redeploy, and a test can `monkeypatch.setenv`
    it. Anything unrecognized is OFF, which is the direction that cannot surprise an operator who
    typo'd the value into a server they believed was enforcing.

    into a raised exception on a statement that already reached the customer's database. Refusing
    *instead of* executing needs the question asked before execution, and this is that question.

    `Store.from_env()` is the probe rather than a DSN parse because it is not a parse:
    `Store.connect` calls `psycopg2.connect` / `sqlite3.connect` eagerly, so constructing one either
    reaches the database or raises. It is also the identical call `_record_query` will make, which
    is what makes the answer relevant rather than merely adjacent — a probe that opens a different
    connection than the writer would is a probe of something else.

    **Costs one connect per served call.** Deliberate and measured against the alternatives: a cached
    health flag is stale in exactly the direction that matters (it says yes while the store is
    already gone), and anything cheaper does not establish reachability at all. The deployment

    The caller of a non-ok outcome also passes the statement it RECEIVED rather than the one that

    This is the layer that makes "no executor escapes the limit" true. The inner deadline lives
    inside the BUILT-IN executor's engine functions, so before this an INJECTED executor — the
    hosted connection-reuse path — ran with no per-statement bound at all, and even on the built-in
    path BigQuery has no watchdog (it has no connection object to cancel), so a client-side stall
    there was unbounded too. Both are bounded here, and deliberately by the same layer: applying
    this only to non-built-in executors would leave the BigQuery hole open while looking closed.

    **The mechanism is a worker thread, because this layer holds nothing it can cancel.** An
    arbitrary ``Executor`` exposes one method and no connection, so the only thing this code owns is
    its own WAIT — it starts the call on a daemon thread and joins with the budget.

    **The cost is an abandoned worker, and it is real.** On expiry the thread is still inside the
    driver call, and it stays there: nothing here cancels it, and it may hold a database connection
    (and, on the server side, a running statement) until that call returns on its own. It is a
    daemon so it cannot hold the interpreter open at exit. This is a bound on how long a CALLER
    waits, not a promise that the work stopped — which is exactly why the inner watchdog, the layer
    that really can cancel, is set to fire first.

    **And the cost is CAPPED, because bounding the wait removed the ceiling that used to bound it.**
    Before this layer existed the same slow call blocked the caller's own worker thread, so the
    host's thread limiter capped how much abandoned work could be in flight and applied backpressure
    to everything behind it. Returning at the bound frees that slot, so on the injected path — where
    there is no inner watchdog and EVERY slow statement abandons one — the abandonments would
    otherwise accumulate without limit until the pool, and with it the datasource, belonged entirely
    to work nobody is waiting for. So the count is capped by ``_MAX_ABANDONED_WORKERS`` and checked
    BEFORE a worker is started: at the cap this refuses immediately rather than starting abandonment
    N+1, and says the executor is saturated rather than blaming a statement that never ran. The slot
    is released when the abandoned worker finally returns, which is the moment the leak actually
    ends.

    Exceptions cross the thread boundary with their ORIGINAL type, re-raised here. That is what
    keeps the handlers in ``execute_guarded`` correct: ``_ResourceLimit`` still reaches the refusal
    branch and ``ExecutorError`` still reaches the classified one, rather than every executor
    failure arriving as a worker that finished having produced nothing. ``BaseException`` is caught
    rather than ``Exception`` for the same reason: a driver's deep ``sys.exit`` raises ``SystemExit``,
    which ``tools._run_in_process`` nets one layer up, and swallowing it in a worker thread would
    turn that fail-closed answer into a silent hang until the bound expired.

    The call runs inside a copy of the CALLER's context, and what that is FOR changed when the
    per-call row cap went (ACE-087). It used to carry ``_max_rows_override`` to ``_resolve_row_cap``
    inside the worker; the cap is the deployment's environment now and needs no carrier. What it
    still carries is the *caller's* request scope — ``tools._current_org_ctx``, the resolve-once
    request cache, the actor and session on the served path — into the one place a consumer's own
    code runs. That is the point of the ``Executor`` seam: a pooled / per-user-RBAC executor picks
    its connection from exactly that context, and a new thread starts with an empty one, so dropping
    the copy would hand every injected executor a blank request to serve.

    """The un-bypassable guarded envelope — the single execution chokepoint (REQ-002/REQ-014).

    In fixed order: read-only / dangerous-SQL guard (the hard security gate — NOT bypassable via
    ``no_safety``, which skips only the semantic-model pass, never write/RCE/DoS protection) ->
    semantic-model safety pass (the scope gates; the fan/chasm and PII checks became receipt facts,
    and declared ``default_filters`` are not applied here either — which of them the statement
    satisfied became a receipt fact too, per table reference) ->
    resolve the datasource -> ``executor.execute(vetted_sql, …)``. The executor only ever receives
    SQL both guards have passed.

    **Every path returns exactly one ``Envelope``, and this function is TOTAL** — nothing is raised
    out of here for a caller to interpret, so the subprocess ``main`` and the in-process MCP handler
    cannot disagree about what happened. The six outcomes:

      * the read-only gate refuses            -> ``refused`` carrying that gate's ``Refusal``
      * ``_model_safety`` returns a Refusal   -> ``refused`` carrying it verbatim
      * either time bound fired               -> ``refused`` carrying ``resource_limit``
      * ``executor.execute`` raises           -> ``failed`` carrying a classified ``Failure``
      * anything else raises                  -> ``failed``/``other``, generic message, raw to the log
      * the statement ran                     -> ``ok`` carrying the ``ExecResult``

    The whole body is inside the try, and the catch-all is what makes "exactly one Envelope" a
    property rather than a claim. It was neither before: ``_model_safety`` sat outside the try
    entirely, ``_load_credentials`` was inside it but only ``ExecutorError`` was caught (a malformed
    or duplicate-section credentials file raises ``configparser.Error``), an injected executor
    raising anything else escaped, and an executor returning ``None`` made ``_envelope("ok", …)``
    raise out of ``Envelope.__post_init__``. Each of those propagated past the chokepoint to
    ``tools._run_in_process``, which catches only ``SystemExit`` — so the caller got an exception
    instead of an Envelope AND no audit row was written, because the row is written by the
    serializer the exception skipped. That matters most for the hosted path: ``ports.Executor``
    exists so a consumer can inject a pooled / per-user-RBAC / SSH-tunnel executor, and a pooled
    executor raising its own ``PoolError`` must not be able to leave the chokepoint silently.

    ``SystemExit`` and ``KeyboardInterrupt`` are not ``Exception`` and deliberately still escape: a
    process being torn down is not a query outcome to report.

    ``_load_credentials`` sits INSIDE the try deliberately, so a bad profile / missing DSN becomes a
    ``failed``/``dsn`` Envelope carrying its detailed message rather than escaping as an exception
    the two callers would each have to translate. The row cap is the deployment's alone
    (``AGAMI_SQL_MAX_ROWS``); no caller can lower it for one call."""
    # Clear before anything can set it, so a detail from a PREVIOUS call in this context can never
    # be attributed to this one. The recorder reads it unconditionally; a stale value would put the
    # wrong error text on a row that succeeded.

    # context must never be attributed to this one. This is the clear that makes the recorder's
    # unconditional read safe — without it a statement that reported nothing would inherit whoever
    # ran the statement before it, which is worse than the null it should have written.
    _last_executing_identity.set(None)
    # Same reason again: a verdict left behind by an earlier call in this context must never label

    # strictly worse than no value — it would be believed.

    # CHANGE during it. The gate below and the receipt built after it have to be two statements about
