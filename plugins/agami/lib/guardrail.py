"""Shared guardrail contract — ``Verdict``, ``policy``, and the response ``Envelope``.

The one result shape for the three SQL-execution guardrails: **safety** (reject) ·
**data-protection** (mask) · **governance** (warn). Every gate produces a ``Verdict``; one
``policy`` maps a verdict to an action by class + deployment tier; and every surface returns one
``Envelope``. Each guardrail builds to these types and never defines its own result shape.

**Stdlib-only, dataclasses only — keep it that way.** This module is vendored into the
marketplace plugin (``plugins/agami/lib/``) and imported by ``ports`` (which must stay
dependency-free), so it must never grow a third-party import. The vendored-purity guard depends
on this staying pure.
