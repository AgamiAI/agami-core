"""Curation engine for the semantic model — the model-native replacement for the
legacy compute_confidence.py + apply_model_exclusions.py + the review/explorer
item-building logic.

Two read views + one write path, all over the on-disk model tree:

  review_queue(org)   -> the trust-review items: entries needing sign-off
                         (review_state != approved) or low confidence
                         (proposed / inferred), partitioned Rule 1 (metrics) vs
                         Rule 2 (relationships / entities). Feeds the Review tab of /agami-model.
  model_tree(org)     -> the browsable area→table→column tree with each node's
                         review_state. Feeds /agami-model (the explorer).
  apply(root, ops)    -> flip review_state (exclude/include/approve/reject), record
                         sign-off, or edit a field — on the canonical YAMLs, gated
                         by the validator, best-effort git-committed, with revert on
                         validation failure. The single write path both skills use.

Locators address an entry uniquely: {kind, area, name, [column]} where kind ∈
{table, column, entity, metric, relationship}. relationships use name = "from->to".

    *column*, a blank description is ambiguous (correctly-self-evident vs. skipped);

    columns worth a line). A table enrichment **never ran on** has ZERO — that's the
    failure mode where the model got table descriptions but no column pass.

    Two failure modes gate `ok`:
      - `unenriched` — a table with `described == 0 AND ai_unknown == 0` (≥ `_MIN_GATE_COLS`

        `*_id`/`*_date`/`created_*`/…). Those are SKIPPED meaningful columns — the pass should
        have described them or marked them `ai_unknown`. `blank_meaningful_columns` names them.
    `ok` is true only when neither list has entries. Rejected tables/columns are excluded.
