"""Org context for the LLM + the explorer — separated into two homes that never collide.

The architecture deliberately keeps the human's words and the auto-derived facts apart:

* **ORGANIZATION.md** is the human's narrative ONLY (what the company/product is, who the
  users are). agami never writes facts into it, so there is nothing for a human to
  accidentally overwrite or delete. `starter_organization_md()` is the blank-path prompt.
* **The factual context** — shape, subject areas, conventions, and the decoded glossary — is
  `derived_context()`, computed FRESH from the structured model at read time. The glossary
  lives in the structured `key_terminology` field, not inline prose, so it always reaches the
  LLM regardless of what's in (or missing from) ORGANIZATION.md.

`compose_context(human_md, org)` assembles the two for a reader (MCP / query skill / explorer):
the human's narrative, then the derived summary under its own heading. Never a re-listing of
the model — counts and bounded summaries only, so it stays usable at thousands of tables.
