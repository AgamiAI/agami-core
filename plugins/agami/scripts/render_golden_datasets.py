"""
Golden-dataset explorer renderer.

Reads every golden dataset for a profile, reads the model the explorer reads, and writes one
self-contained HTML file — the sixth of these, after the chart, the model explorer, the
examples-validation queue, the prune view and the golden-run report, and deliberately the same
shape as the five.

A run report says what broke. This page says what the dataset IS, which is the question asked
before a run and after it: how many cases exist, how many can actually fail a run, what the model
defines that no answer key exercises, and which cases the reader has already reported a fault on.

Three properties are the whole point of the page, and each is pinned by a test rather than by this
paragraph:

* **What can gate is counted apart from what exists.** A dataset of forty questions with three
  confirmed answer keys gates on three, and a page that printed one number would read as forty
  questions of coverage.
* **Coverage is computed, never declared.** The tables a confirmed answer key reads come from
  `semantic_model.golden_claims`, the one reader of a statement in this repository — the
  author-declared `expected.tables_used` is exactly the blind spot this page exists to catch.
* **The page may weaken a claim and may never strengthen one.** Withdrawing confirmation needs no
  evidence; granting it from a browser is forging ground truth, and it is the easiest possible way
  to make a failing suite green. There is no control for it here and no statement is editable.

Unlike the golden-run report beside it this one is not stdlib-only, and the difference is
deliberate: reading a claim needs a SQL parser, and the alternative — trusting what the author
declared the statement reads — would report coverage the dataset does not have.

Usage:

    python3 render_golden_datasets.py \\
        --profile demo \\
        --artifacts-dir ~/agami-artifacts \\
        --out <artifacts_dir>/local/eval/demo/datasets-20260901-141500.html
