"""Scaffold an `/agami-deploy` bundle on the user's machine: copy the carried templates, stage the
model artifacts, and write `agami.env` with the NON-SECRET values the skill gathered.

This helper never touches a secret: the admin password is typed by the user into the file afterwards
(the agami-connect hand-off pattern), `deploy_preflight` generates the signing secret, and an external
`APP_DATABASE_URL` (itself a credential) is likewise edited into `agami.env` by the user — never passed
here on the command line. On a re-run over an EXISTING bundle it upgrades non-destructively: every value the
user typed is kept, keys new in this version are appended (so an upgrade surfaces e.g. `DATASOURCE_URL`), and
the image tag bumps only if one was passed.

Stdout is a single status line (first token machine-readable); the skill reads it and acts. Stdlib only.
