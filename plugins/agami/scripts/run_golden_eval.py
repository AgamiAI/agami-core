"""Run one golden dataset for a profile and print the verdicts as JSON.

`semantic_model.golden_run.run_golden_dataset` is a function with five required keyword arguments
and no command of its own, so this is the wiring that lets a person — or a skill — reach it. It
does three things nothing upstream does: it chooses the dataset, it renders the tables and columns
the generator is given, and it decides what a verdict looks like on a terminal.

**The exit code is the contract a pipeline gates on**: `0` every confirmed case passed, `1` a
confirmed case failed, `2` no verdict could be produced — the preflight refused, the run stopped
partway, or every generation errored. `2` reads as "go look at the harness", never as "the model
regressed". See `_verdict`, whose ordering is the whole of that distinction.

**Stdout carries verdicts and never SQL.** Neither the answer key nor the generated statement
appears in the printed payload — nor the answer key's own column names, which two of the
comparator's reasons are built out of — so a terminal that gets pasted into a chat window carries
no statement with it. All of it is written to a JSON artifact instead, beside the run's other
output.

Unlike the stdlib-only helpers beside it, this one imports the agami-core package: the runner, the
reader, the chokepoint and the model loader all live there, and re-implementing any of them here
would be a second definition of a verdict.

Usage:

    python3 run_golden_eval.py --profile main --list
    python3 run_golden_eval.py --profile main --dataset orders --timeout-s 120
    python3 run_golden_eval.py --profile main --dataset orders --tag smoke --tag revenue
    python3 run_golden_eval.py --profile main --dataset orders --rerun-failures

**What a run sends outbound.** Generating a statement spawns the operator's own client with every
tool switched off, and hands it the question, the organization, the datasource name and the tables
and columns of the semantic model. It is handed neither the answer key nor any result row —
generation finishes before anything is executed, so no row exists yet. It is not told where the
dataset lives either, though that withholds a name rather than a capability: the child keeps `HOME`
and is given the profile's name, and what actually stops it reading the answer key off disk is that
it is started with no tools to read one with. That
egress is the operator's own model provider and nothing else. It matters most in CI, where the
model's vocabulary leaves a shared runner rather than one person's machine, and where the
credential is whatever the environment supplies to the client.
