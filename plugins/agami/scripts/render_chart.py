"""
HTML report renderer for agami-query.

Reads plugins/agami/shared/chart-template.html, substitutes every placeholder
(including the inline agami logos from shared/agami-logo-{dark,light}.svg),
and writes a self-contained HTML file containing one or more sections. Each
section has its own chart + table + insight + SQL — but they all live in
the same file. Stdlib only.

The agami-query SKILL invokes this script in Phase 4e instead of
doing template substitution through the LLM's Read + Write tools — that
path costs ~30KB of token I/O per query (template + two SVG logos) and is
the dominant slowness in chart rendering. Calling this script keeps the
LLM's job to producing a small JSON sections file, and the cheap shell
substitution lives here.

Usage (single section — backwards compatible with the old chart):

    python render_chart.py \\
        --title "Top customers" \\
        --summary "Carol Chen leads at $148.95, ahead of the next customer by 3x." \\
        --section '{
          "title": "Top customers by spend",
          "insights": "Carol Chen leads at $148.95.",
          "chart_type": "bar",
          "labels": ["Carol Chen","Dave Davis","Bob Brown"],
          "datasets": [{"label":"Spend","data":[148.95,93.96,45.0]}],
          "table_headers": ["Customer","Spend"],
          "table_rows": [["Carol Chen",148.95],["Dave Davis",93.96],["Bob Brown",45.0]],
          "sql": "SELECT c.name, SUM(...) FROM ..."
        }' \\
        --out <artifacts_dir>/local/charts/single.html

Usage (multi-section narrative):

    python render_chart.py \\
        --title "How is the business doing?" \\
        --summary "Revenue up 12% QoQ; Carol Chen is the top customer; pending orders growing." \\
        --sections-file my-report.json \\
        --out <artifacts_dir>/local/charts/q1-review.html

The file `my-report.json` is a JSON array of section objects, see the
SECTIONS_JSON schema documented in shared/chart-template.html.

# vendored stdlib-only into `plugins/agami/lib/` and every sibling script that needs the library
# reaches it through `_agami_lib.ensure_importable()`. The reason is narrower: this renderer's only
# use for the names is to validate a JSON blob, and importing a module to read one tuple would make
# a pure template substitution fail wherever the vendored lib is absent or stale. What the copy
# owes is that it stays EQUAL to the source, and a copy nothing compares is a copy that drifts — so
# `tests/test_render_chart_receipt.py` asserts the two tuples are the same, and a sixth section
# added to the type fails there rather than leaving the renderer quietly validating five.
